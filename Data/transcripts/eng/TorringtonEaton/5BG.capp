*CHI: um just about all of them .
*INV: just about all of them ?
*INV: okay .
*INV: well can I ask dont mix them up .
*INV: okay ?
*CHI: why ?
*INV: well because then all the colors are mixed and then they dont have then you cant make rainbows if theyre all mixed up .
*INV: I mean .
*CHI: well we cant make rainbows if theyre not mixed up .
*INV: well so when I say dont mix them up I mean dont .
*INV: let me show you .
*INV: dont go like this and mix them up like that .
*INV: okay ?
*INV: if youre gonna make a rainbow then you make .
*INV: actually thats too much to make a rainbow I think .
*INV: we can both make rainbows .
*INV: so if you make a rainbow like this and you make one stripe like this ?
*INV: right ?
*INV: and then you make another stripe .
*INV: you know like a rainbow actually you can see the separate stripes right ?
*INV: and you put them side by side .
*CHI: um is this enough playdough to use ?
*INV: can I see ?
*INV: I think thats good for a stripe .
*INV: yeah .
*INV: so well put the other one here .
*INV: can we both make rainbows ?
*CHI: yeah .
*INV: okay .
*INV: that sounds like a great idea .
*INV: so can I ask you .

*CHI: and Sam Cooper .
*INV: wow youve got a lot of friends .
*CHI: what do we need to push them together ?
*INV: well so what Im gonna do .
*INV: Ill show you .
*INV: I dont think you really have to push them together because you just have to bend them .
*INV: right ?
*INV: in the shape of a rainbow ?
*INV: I was gonna add some more colors .
*INV: do you want more colors ?
*CHI: yeah .
*INV: now what I would do is I would roll them a little bit more .
*INV: so that they bend easier .
*INV: you know what I mean ?
*CHI: is this big enough ?
*INV: yeah roll it a little bit more .
*INV: otherwise its really hard to bend I think .
*CHI: is this good ?
*INV: yeah I think thats good .
*CHI: this one needs to roll a little bit .
*INV: I would roll that one a little bit more .
*INV: now do you want you want more colors dont you ?
*CHI: yeah .
*INV: okay .
*INV: and you havent rolled the red one yet .
*INV: or the blue one .
*CHI: no .
*INV: so youve got work to do still .
*CHI: but this is gonna break .
*INV: roll it some more .
*INV: I think itll be okay .
*INV: I dont know if I want pink in my rainbow .
*INV: do you want pink ?
*CHI: yeah .
*INV: yes ?
*CHI: is this enough ?
*INV: yeah I think thats good .
*INV: heres pink .
*INV: oh we definitely need purple .
*INV: dont you think ?
*CHI: yeah .
*CHI: is this enough ?
*INV: I think that might be a little too much .
*INV: that time .
*CHI: how about this ?
*INV: thats good .
*INV: what is that out there ?
*INV: that bottle .
*CHI: its for its for Matthew and daddys experiment .
*INV: they have an experiment ?
*INV: what are they doing ?
*CHI: theyre doing something about weather .
*INV: about the weather ?
*CHI: yeah .
*INV: wow .
*INV: that looks kind of neat .
*CHI: is this big enough ?
*INV: I think so .
*CHI: do I need to bend it like this ?
*INV: well try it .
*INV: does it work ?
*CHI: yeah .
*INV: good .
*INV: what do you think of my rainbow ?
*INV: does it need more colors or is it enough ?
*CHI: Im gonna do .
*CHI: oh I definitely need purple .
*INV: you definitely need purple .
*INV: and I think you should use pink in yours .
*INV: I think that would look nice .
*INV: I dont want pink in mine .
*INV: I dont think the red and the pink go together very well .
*CHI: is this long enough ?
*INV: yeah .
*INV: thats good .
*INV: I noticed that the ones on the outside have to be a little bit longer .
*INV: so which way are you gonna bend ?
*INV: are you gonna bend it .
*CHI: I bended it around .
*CHI: see ?
*INV: okay .
*INV: yep .
*INV: so the pink one has to be a little bit longer .
*CHI: why ?
*INV: well because see how my red one I had to make it a little bit longer .
*INV: the purple one gets all bent because actually its too long I think .
*INV: I dont know .
*INV: yours is gonna work .
*INV: its gonna be fine .
*INV: Im not trying to worry you .
*INV: Im sure itll turn out great .
*CHI: look at mine .
*INV: its looking good .
*CHI: not finished yet .
*INV: no ?
*INV: which ones do you want ?
*INV: what color ?
*CHI: I want some orange in my rainbow .
*INV: sure .
*INV: how about this one ?
*CHI: thats perfect .
*INV: good .
*CHI: actually I think this ones a little too long .
*INV: okay .
*INV: what is today ?
*INV: the nineteenth we said right ?
*INV: do you play with playdough a lot ?
*CHI: well we .
*CHI: well I cant pick it up .

*INV: I was thinking maybe you shouldnt tell your sister and then well see what she comes up with .
*INV: what she makes .
*INV: maybe shell make a rainbow too but maybe she wont .
*CHI: Im gonna get my mom in here so she can see my rainbow .
*INV: okay .
*INV: thats a good idea .
*CHI: but I was thinking I would bring it in the living room so she could see it but .
*INV: well its up to you .
*INV: if you want to show her that sounds fine .
*INV: go show her .
*CHI: but its falling off .
*INV: oh well let me help you get it all together .
