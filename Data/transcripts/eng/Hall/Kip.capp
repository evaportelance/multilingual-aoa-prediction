*FCH: like if we dont we hafta listen eh every every single day .
*TCA: but if you wanna tell the class something do you want everyone to chatter while youre telling it to them or you want them to listen ?
*FCH: mm well .
*FCH: mostly they could listen .
*TCA: well I think I have something interesting and I think all the children would like to listen .
*TCA: if you really dont wanna you can go in another corner and play with something by yourself .
*TCA: but if you think its interesting you can stay and listen .
*TCA: and to me .
*TCA: and watch and ask anything you wanna .
*MCH: ya hafta put the cement ?
*MCH: on first so it wont .
*FCH: why do you need the shovel so full ?
*TCA: dats I think .
*GRO: let me see ?
*TCA: this soil is thats a very good question .
*TCA: this soil was picked to be very clean soil without any dirt .
*FCH: why dont you just scoop and itll be easier .
*TCA: without any things in it like dog defecation or urine sothat the plants will grow nicely .
*MCH: haha .
*FCH: pan here a pan .
*TCA: and the sand might change the soil a little and it wont grow as quickly so I went to the store and I bought special soil that had nothing in it that would prevent the plants from growing quickly .
*TCA: that was very good .
*TCA: Im proud .
*TCA: anyone else wanna say something ?
*UNK: I do .
*TCA: yes a .
*UNK: I do .
*TCA: Adam first .
*MCH: I have a xxx like that at home put in the bathroom .
*MCH: what whatre those li .
*MCH: what ?
*MCH: whyd ya ?
*MCH: whyd ya ?
*MCH: why ya have ta have blue stuff instead uh .
*MCH: can xxx the other cups and they hafta be the exact same size ?
*TCA: I thats another good question .
*TCA: I only chose these juice cups because I happen to have them in my house .
*TCA: and I knew that if anyone would takes this home it would take up too much room so it would be easier to carry without dropping .
*MCH: oh .
*TEA: I noticed that they were plastic do you think thats a good idea ?
*UNK: know what ?
*MCH: teacher it glass it might drop and it might it might break .
*TEA: right .
*TEA: what if they were just paper ?
*MCH: they rip .
*TEA: they could rip .
*TEA: mhm .
*MCH: and when they dry then they would get gaibluda ba .
*FCH: and they wo .
*FCH: and they are open .
*UNK: today xxx .
*TCA: but I wanna tell you something its a good idea for us to em in plastic .
*TCA: but boys and girls if we are really planting things .
*TCA: kid and Alexander .
*TCA: its better not to use something like this .
*TCA: because when we water it excuse me Polette .
*TCA: when we plant something at home or here in school and we plant it in a regular planter that we buy in the store youll notice if you go to the store they have little holes on the bottom .
*TCA: does anybody in this class have plants at home ?
*UNK: I do .
*MCH: uh I do .
*FCH: xxx do .
*CHI: I do .
*GRO: I do .
*TCA: you do ?
*FCH: my daddy has a whole garden .
*TCA: Kip when you go home and when you go home you ask if mommy or daddy or anyone in your house to pick up one of the planters thats not a big heavy one and youll notice at the bottom there might be a hole .
*TCA: Adam would you know why there might be a hole ?
*UNK: why ?
*TCA: why ?
*TCA: thats a good question why .
*MCH: because when we water one theres a hole in the bottom of the glass .
*TCA: plant .
*FCH: because the water would run on the ground .
*MCH: and it would go right through right on to the xxx room floor .
*UNK: there aint no floor under there .
*MCH: because it because it hanging on the ceiling .
*TCA: well the reason that does anybody wanna know why there might be a hole at the bottom ?
*UNK: no .
*MCH: I do .
*FCH: why ?
*FCH: I do .
*TCA: well when we put water into the water the plant so they could grow .
*FCH: ah .
*FCH: now I know what youre gonna say .
*TCA: yes tell me .
*FCH: youre gonna say so when you put in the water itll soak out in the hole floor .
*TCA: some of it will come out if theres too much water it will drain outof the hole .
*TCA: so what you do when in the store alotof times and leave a little hole .
*FCH: but then but then under the plant will get wet .
*TCA: thats right .
*TCA: but what we do alotof times we have a little cup under it .
*TCA: and alotof the planters have a little hole and a little cup attached to it so if any water drains off .
*FCH: or just a little cup under it .
*FCH: xxx so if the water drains off it wont get on the rug rurg and itll and it wont have lotsof water all over your house .
*TCA: that .
*TCA: if anybody .
*TCA: excuse me theres a young lady thats moving a little bit too much .
*TCA: can you move back to where you were ?
*TCA: no .
*UNK: tie my shoe .
*TCA: tie your shoe ?
*TCA: I didnt know Alice Mary was teacher now .
*TCA: you sit over here okay ?
*FCH: xxx I want it tied .
*TCA: well tie it in a second were not walking yet assoonas were ready to get up and walk Ill make sure everyone shoes tied .
*TCA: now you can look .
*TCA: before we get the plants in Im gonna choose somebody .
