*MCH: you elephant .
*FAD: um hm .
*MOT: so then now yesterday when I got the initial note about the possibility sad news just forthcoming .
*MOT: from my friend who didnt just wanna drop the bomb to me on the phone .
*MOT: I interpreted I thought gee maybe the fact that Copoyas recommendation wasnt in was a factor .
*MOT: after all it was a logical thought so I went and bothered one of his secretaries who I had asked about it oh two weeks ago which I dont think it was hardly early considering he observed me last October would you ?
*CHI: and nobody can come and nobody can come xxx .
*FAD: hunm .
*MOT: and its technically sposta be in the term youre observed .
*FAD: mhm .
*MOT: so anyway as secretaries are wont to do she must have made a bothering call to him again .
*FAD: um mm .
*MOT: hes just late thats all and lazy .
*FAD: um hm .
*MOT: Im mean hes just involved in other alright more important but you know mines equally important to me .
*MOT: so anyway he called me last night .
*FAD: um hm .
*MOT: because he is also he serves on the PandB promotion and budget committee of the english department and he already had known about this cut .
*FAD: uh huh .
*MOT: and ah I cant understand his use of this word talking about study of language he said ah .
*MOT: I was appalled to hear appalled list to this word Elliot said what utter arrogance utter .

*CHI: weasel it is a long one .
*FAD: isnt this something ?
*FAD: probably just defensive you know .
*MOT: so I just decided I wasnt gonna eat any of that business and I said well I said um although the matters been somewhat clarified since as a budgetary cut I said given the politics of the english department and the politics of survival in the city university system ah I think it was fairly relevant to have to ask that my fall term observations be in in time for a spring term decision I wasnt going to back down .
*FAD: um um good .
*MOT: I dont you know I just wasnt because I was right .
*FAD: good .
*MOT: so then he went on in a most conciliatory manner haha to tell me that he thought I oughta file a union class grievance which of course will come to no effect .
*FAD: against him haha .
