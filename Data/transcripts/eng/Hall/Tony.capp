*EXP: it and this one is green everything is cool because its it indicates the modulations of the voice .
*FAT: mm .
*EXP: um or whatever signals being inputed you know ?
*EXP: but this one you know lot a times it to me it in the past it has meant that theres you know some kind of interference .
*EXP: and I just dont how ta deal with it .
*EXP: because what it what it means is since I hafta transcribe that I hafta set there and listen real hard and stuff and I dont .
*FAT: oh .
*EXP: particularly wanna do that through um uh hundred and forty tapes .
*EXP: you know so but then its all um uh due to atmospheric conditions which change drastically and it that could be the reason why why yer hav you know like your signal might be fading in and out .
*FAT: it does that from time to time .
*EXP: uhhuh yeah .
*FAT: are you ready Tony ?
*CHI: yeah .
*FAT: cmon quit doing that .
