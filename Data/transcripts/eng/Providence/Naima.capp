*CHI: I think so .
*CHI: xxx get the Tig .
*CHI: where where where icicles go down from .
*MOT: if we use less oil there will be fewer oil tankers in the oceans .
*CHI: Daddy will be surprised .
*ADU: maybe just coloring or something .

*MOT: you might be surprised .
*MOT: oh this forecaster is giving us good advice I think .
*ADU: well I have plenty of stuff and Im glad to bring it .

*CHI: get the Tig .
*MOT: more snow .
*MOT: electricity is often produced by burning oil .
*GRA: I think you might be sitting on part of Tig .
