*CHI: I named him hes called .
*CHI: rock .
*MOT: as her eyes filled with tears something she didnt know what made her rock faster than ever before she closed her eyes there was a tremendous whistling in her ears .
*MOT: the next minute she was tumbling head over heels through the air then floating gently down to land on something soft .
*MOT: Sophie blinked her eyes .
*MOT: where was she exactly ?
*MOT: hello Sophie growled a voice from above her head she opened her eyes and looked up .
*MOT: the legs of a bed her bed towered above her it must have grown .
*MOT: peaking over the edge of her quilt was big Ted next to him was little Ted .
*MOT: see them ?
*MOT: hello Sophie squeaked little Ted .
*MOT: her teddy bears were talking she looked around she was tiny .

*MOT: big Ted tied one end of a cord to the bed and dropped the other end to the floor it was the sash of Sophies bathrobe the bears climbed down it .
*MOT: lets call the other toys suggested Samantha wake up everybody she cried .
*MOT: suddenly all of Sophies toys sprang to life .
*MOT: Sophies tiniest dolls dashed out of the dollhouse and the toys that had been put into the toybox jumped down from it .
*MOT: lets play suggested big Ted .
*MOT: this is fun said Sophie .

*MOT: wheres .
*CHI: or maybe the bears gonna climb up .
*MOT: oh yeah I dont know .
*MOT: wheres Peter asked Sophie suddenly .
*MOT: they looked everywhere but Peter the panda was no where to be found .
*MOT: they gazed at each other in dismay then Sophie heard a soft noise .
*MOT: everyone stood still and listened .
*MOT: someones calling said the fairy doll who had very good hearing .
*MOT: its coming from the top of the bookcase said Sophie .
*MOT: they crowded beneath the bookcase a tiny black and white head appeared over the top high above them it was Peter the panda .
*MOT: Im stuck he squeaked in a tiny voice .
*MOT: gosh said Sophie I must have put you there when I was told to straighten up my room .
*MOT: please get me down begged Peter the panda but how asked Sophie .

*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: I know a way said big Ted he ran off and came back pushing Sophies toy fire engine we can use this what a good idea .
*MOT: it stretched higher and higher into the air just the way a real fire engines ladder does until the very top of it was resting against the bookcase .
*MOT: now climb down Peter shouted Samantha .
*MOT: oh no I cant said Peter dont worry said big Ted Ill get him down .
*MOT: he climbed up the ladder and lifted Peter onto his shoulders .
*MOT: everybody cheered and clapped when big Ted carried Peter safely to the ground .
*MOT: thank you said Sophie hugging big Ted and kissing his cheek .
*MOT: just then the clock on the bedroom wall went cuckoo .
*MOT: uhoh said Sophie its time for bed I hafta go .
*MOT: bye bye toys thank you .
*MOT: goodbye shouted the toys .
*MOT: please come again .
*MOT: Sophie climbed onto the back of the magic rocking horse and began to rock .
*MOT: in an instant she was back in her bedroom a big girl again .
*MOT: big Ted and little Ted were slumped at the foot of the bed .
*MOT: the fireengine with Samantha the doll leaning against it was down on the floor .
*MOT: the rest of the toys were all back in their normal places .
*MOT: it seemed as though Sophies adventure in toyland never happened .
*MOT: the sash of her bathrobe was still dangling down the side of the bed and Peter the panda was lying safe on Sophies pillow .
*MOT: lucky Sophie had been to toyland she had a delightful adventure with all her toys and she had found Peter and panda too .
*MOT: now she couldnt wait to go to bed .
*BRO: Peter and panda xxx .

*BRO: xxx maybe its just a xxx .
*MOT: because I wanted to do a puzzle with Violet Violet you wanna do the dinosaur floor puzzle with me while Max does his Legos for a few minutes ?
*CHI: mom ?
*CHI: I want to look at this one .
*MOT: unicorn one .
*CHI: yeah unicorn one .
*MOT: okay .
*CHI: unicorn one .
*MOT: the spring unicorn ?
*CHI: yeah the spring .
*MOT: okay then thats it because these are long ones .
*MOT: okay ?
*CHI: spring unicorn .
*MOT: far away beyond the widest oceans lies the enchanted land of Feria .
*MOT: the people of Feria are always happy for the summers are long the falls are beautiful the springs are a joy and the winters although a little cold are short .
*MOT: it is such a beautiful place and the crops grow so well that there is little for the Ferian people to do but enjoy themselves in the sun .
*MOT: so they rarely work and instead spend their days playing having parties making music and telling each other wonderful stories .
*MOT: hey I wanna go there do you ?
*BRO: what are xxx ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: some people might say that they are lazy but they wouldnt care because theyre just so happy .
*MOT: but one year it wasnt like that .
*MOT: that year in fact the people of Feria were far from happy indeed they were very worried .
*MOT: for although spring should have arrived weeks before it hadnt none of the winter snows were gone yet .
*MOT: and lakes had not thawed the birds were not building their nests and the buds of the flowers in the mountain meadows had had failed to open .
*MOT: not good enough said the king something must be done .
*MOT: which one you thinks the king Violet ?
*MOT: let Violet choose please Maxwell .
*MOT: which one do you think Violet ?
*MOT: the same as he said ?
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: I was gonna guess that guy .
*MOT: because you know why ?
*CHI: why ?
*MOT: he looks older and he was the one talking but then when Max pointed to that one I think hes right because that one has the crown on .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: but its funny the kings usually old isnt he ?
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: all the men and women of great council except for one shook their heads for they did not know the answer but the oldest and wisest member stood up .
*MOT: it is because the spring unicorn the bringer of spring has not visited Feria this year he explained without his arrival there can be no spring .
*MOT: the king and the other members of the council looked at each other and frowned but why has the spring unicorn not come to Feria asked the king .
*MOT: doesnt he like us anymore ?
*MOT: I think it could be because we are so busy enjoying ourselves that we never thank the spring unicorn for all he does for us it could be that he thinks we are lazy and dont deserve to live in such a wonderful place suggested the wisest council member .
*MOT: but we must pay that put that right at once said the king all the people in the land must leave the warmth of their homes and go out and start work immediately .
*MOT: they must start um they must um .
*MOT: the king wanted to describe the sorts of things that people should be doing when they went out to work but the trouble was he knew nothing about work so he didnt know what to say .
*MOT: finally he said they er they must you know they must bustle about being busy doing work and things .
*MOT: do you know what a work thing is Violet ?
*CHI: sweeping .
*MOT: sweeping is one kind of work do you know any other kind of work ?
*MOT: in the winter yeah thats a type of work in the winter .
*MOT: digging too yep so because the king told them to the people of Feria went to work at first they didnt even know what to do .
*MOT: then when they looked up the word in the Feria dictionary and they found out what was involved they didnt like the sound of it and grumbled a lot among themselves .
*MOT: but as time passed they discovered that they actually enjoyed being busy they shoveled the snow from the paths in their gardens they cleared snow from the roads .
*MOT: they repaired leaking roofs and they even filled all the holes in the road .
*MOT: and they still laughed and sang the way they used to before the spring failed to arrive and the king ordered them all to go to work .
*MOT: but it still kept snowing and the lakes didnt thaw and the birds failed to build their nests and the flowers didnt bloom .
*MOT: what can be the matter now the king asked the oldest and wisest member of his council .
*MOT: perhaps the spring unicorn doesnt know how hard we are working said the wise man .
*MOT: well the spring unicorn must be told snapped the king stamping his royal feet .
*MOT: that very day messengers were sent throughout the land to put up posters announcing that anyone who found the spring unicorn and explained how hard the Ferians had been working would receive all the gold they could wish for .
*MOT: the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived .
*MOT: do you know where he lives Violet ?
*CHI: over here .
*MOT: and wheres that ?
*CHI: right here .
*MOT: what do you call that place you think ?
*CHI: the same place .
*MOT: he lives in the same place ?
*MOT: how come they couldnt find him then ?
*CHI: because he was over there .
*MOT: oh they didnt see him ?
*BRO: he lives in the valley .
*MOT: the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived .
*MOT: nobody that was except for a poor musician who was known as the Whistler .
*MOT: Im fed up with winter and Ive got nothing to better to do so I might just as well go and look for the spring unicorn thought the Whistler .
*MOT: see him here ?
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: so he picked up his flute and set off in search of the spring unicorn he traveled far and wide playing his flute to keep him cheerful on his journey .
*MOT: and as he played the notes of the flute danced before him leading him on and on across the widest ocean over the highest mountains .
*MOT: I shall follow the notes of my music wherever they lead me he told himself at long last he came to a valley .
*MOT: hey Max youre right .
*MOT: where no one had ever been before it was the home of the spring unicorn you have no place here boomed a loud voice how how did you a mere Ferian find your way here ?
*MOT: I played my flute and followed the notes explained the Whistler .
*MOT: then he demonstrated with a quick tune .
*MOT: his music was so beautiful that within minutes a whole herd of magical unicorns appeared and danced before him .
*MOT: when he had finally laid down his flute one of the unicorns trotted forward he introduced himself as the spring unicorn .
*MOT: why are you here the spring unicorn asked .
*MOT: because you failed to come to Feria this year .
*MOT: ha exclaimed the spring unicorn I couldnt be bothered to come because the people of Feria are so lazy they do not deserve my beautiful springs .
*MOT: but what you say is no longer true why not Violet ?
*CHI: because .
*MOT: are the people lazy there ?
*CHI: no .
*MOT: why not ?
*CHI: because theyre always working .
*MOT: now they are right ?
*CHI: yeah .
*MOT: we are no longer lazy and we still have time to be happy telling each other wonderful tales and playing beautiful music .
*MOT: maybe you are right said the spring unicorn when the tune had come to an end Ill tell you what Ill do .
*MOT: providing you play your beautiful music on your journey back to Feria I shall accompany you .
*MOT: and we shall see if the people are no longer lazy .
*MOT: can I fly on your back asked the Whistler hopefully ?
*MOT: no said the spring unicorn if we fly the journey will be over too quickly and I wont have time to listen to all that music I want you to play .
*MOT: we shall walk back the way you came .
*MOT: oh drat thought the Whistler but how do they walk across the ocean ?
*MOT: xxx the Whistler returned the way he had come and through his journey he played the most beautiful music .
*MOT: that the spring unicorn followed every step of the way .
*MOT: eventually they arrived in the mountains above Feria look .
*MOT: see them up there ?
*MOT: the Whistler pointing down at the village see how hard the people are working ?
*MOT: indeed they were some were shoveling snow from their gardens but as soon as they had finished more snow fell to replace it .
*MOT: some were clearing snow from the roads .
*MOT: some were fixing leaks but as soon as they finished more snow fell .
*MOT: indeed they are working but are they happy in their work ?
*MOT: listen sad the Whistler .
*MOT: the unicorn listened .
*MOT: faintly from the village came the sound of someone laughing someone else was whistling .
*MOT: someone else was singing .
*MOT: oh yes said the Whistler I think you can say they are happy .
*MOT: I believe you are right you shall have your spring back again .
*MOT: I shall continue to bring a new spring year after year just as long as the people remain happy and contented and do not ever become lazy again .
*MOT: and thats how it was and thats how it still is .
*MOT: and the Whistler well he turned down the kings offer of riches in favor of becoming the spring unicorns helper .
*MOT: which is why every year the Ferian spring is always heralded by the most beautiful music anyone has ever heard .
*MOT: wow .
*CHI: xxx walking across the sea ?
*MOT: this ones called Floyd the friendly shark well read that one later .
