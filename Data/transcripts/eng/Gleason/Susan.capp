*MOT: his was only .
*MOT: his was .
*MOT: I mean like maybe four hundred or five hundred .

*FAT: is the rule of thumb you know you double whatever their preparation is and you get their paying cost ?
*MOT: no I dont know what the rule of thumb is because I didnt ask them all that question .

*FAT: hm .
*MOT: otherwise I couldve had twelve estimates .
*FAT: oh here now .
*FAT: it wasnt that I didnt take you seriously .
*FAT: its just that I just didnt think at the time about how unrealistic it would be for you to try to do the painting yourself .

*MOT: this pussy cat is really trying very hard not to get caught .
*MOT: he climbs up the tree and he jumps over to this branch .
*MOT: now he doesnt have any place to go so Charlie reaches over and gets a hold of the cat and picks up the cat by the back of his neck .
*MOT: and that doesnt bother the pussy cat .
*MOT: cats dont mind being picked up that way .
*CHI: ouch .
