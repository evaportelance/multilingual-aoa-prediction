*FAT: yeah .
*MOT: I said sh .
*FAT: I wish I had had my heart had not been so uh heavy with Juliet .
*FAT: I wouldve enjoyed the opportunity to discuss with her her attitude toward family planing and population control .
*MOT: do you think she has a strong .
*FAT: well its funny that for for a person who makes a point of dedicating herself to the solution of human problems etcetera uh is to some degree .
*MOT: thats true .
*FAT: an idealist uh to say you should be unrestrained in your in the reproduction of your species because essentially its fun which was what her defense was .
*FAT: having kids is .
*FAT: a source of satisfaction to the parents .
*FAT: not necessarily that it was uh good for the kids or anything else .
*FAT: that that they was a comfort in their old age and so forth .
*MOT: what she was saying to me was hm having kids having more than one more than two even is okay if youre if youre the rich and privileged class essentially .
*FAT: but thats terribly elitist .
*FAT: because how long does she expect uh people to be members of the class in which they presently find themselves ?
*FAT: lets say ya know a generation down the road may be two or three .
*FAT: I mean .
*FAT: ya know you have your Adams familys and stuff like that .
*FAT: uh you look at .
*FAT: ya know there was a thing in Time magazine this week on descendants of the uh of the original founding fathers .
*FAT: and theyre plumbers an and whatever ya know ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: mhm .
*FAT: uh and theres no guarantee that that wh when youre talking about a problem the consequences of which are not really gonna be f .
*FAT: well they will be felt immediately .
*MOT: but I think she xxx .
*FAT: but if youre talking about .
*FAT: a problem that is going to become critical in say one more generation or two more generations .
*MOT: mhm .
*FAT: by which time you have no reason to expect that your progeny are gonna have the same .
*MOT: values .
*FAT: well or the or the same resources that youre gonna hafta bring up their children as uh xxx .
*MOT: but what she assumes is that your progeny .
*FAT: nondependents .
*MOT: are much brighter than than the average Americans brightness .
*FAT: okay that that in itself is false .
*FAT: even if they are brighter it doesnt mean that theyre gonna be economically self sustaining .
*FAT: and even if they are economically self sustaining theyre gonna take up space and theyre gonna compete for resources with everybody else .
*CHI: Ma I dropped some .
*FAT: theyre gonna buy ya know .
*FAT: what was before the family uh the family acreage on Nantucket .
*CHI: I spilled some .
*CHI: I spilled some I spilled some I spilled some .
*FAT: was gonna split between the three .
*MOT: thats okay sweetie .
*FAT: male heirs or however they decide to split it .
*CHI: I spilled some .
*CHI: I spilled some I spilled some .
*MOT: I I agree but y your speaking from the conservationists point of view and it would be interesting to hear .
*FAT: well e even even from a human uh from an aesthetic point of view in which she want .
*CHI: I spilled some .
*CHI: I spilled some I spilled some I spilled some I spilled some .
*FAT: I think theres some supposed to be what twice as many people in the by the year two thousand or something like that .
*FAT: does she want that ?
*MOT: I dont know whether she .
*CHI: I spilled I spilled I spilled .
*FAT: it seems to me shes taking very much in the attitude of .
*FAT: I find pleasure in it right now and its somebody elses problem later .
*MOT: you think thats the way shes viewing it ?
*CHI: I spilled it .
*CHI: I spilled .
*MOT: I think shes caught in a funny position in that shes now very much of a a womens movement member .
*FAT: hm .
*MOT: but where she spent her life bringing up her children and doing nothing but bringing up her children .
*FAT: uhhuh .
*MOT: until they was high school age .
*FAT: mhm .
*MOT: you cant really say that was a total waste of time .
*FAT: mhm .
*MOT: first of all she doesnt believe it .
*FAT: yeah .
*CHI: we want water .
*MOT: secondly she doesnt wanna believe it .
*FAT: yeah .
*FAT: see what Im aiming at is that arguments for population control dont say that uh that bringing up children is a waste by any means .
*MOT: mhm .
*FAT: huh .
*MOT: yeah .
*FAT: it acknowledges the fact that children are ya know a rare and xxx unique pleasure .
*FAT: and so xxx its just like alotof other rare and unique pleasures like driving a twelve cylinder car at eighty miles an hour .
*FAT: at times you just cant do it in a world of finite resources .
*MOT: it seems to me that ya uh .
*MOT: I can understand two but more than two no matter how talented and clever you may think you are .
*MOT: if youre talented and clever enough to feel those people who arent will have too many children then you hafta more than make up for your share xxx too many .
*FAT: well thats another thing .
*FAT: it just gets a little funny because first its distinctly .
*FAT: ya know people say that .
*MOT: hey hey hey hey .
*MOT: uhhuh .
*FAT: hey you .
*MOT: thats no good .
*MOT: if you dont wanna eat it thats okay too .
*MOT: but I dont want you playing with it .
*MOT: no good to play .
*CHI: Im just .
*MOT: ya know whats a good thing to eat with ?
*MOT: um your spoon .
*FAT: spoon is very good for cake .
*MOT: spoon is much better for cake for you .
*FAT: what she expresses alotof concern for and seems to have a genuine concern for is reflected in the programs in the Y and so forth .
*FAT: ya know the the disenfranchised the disadvantaged the poor the needy and so forth and so on .
*FAT: uh and then she turns around and says that uh .
*CHI: what are you doing ?
*CHI: whaddaya .
*FAT: you as members of the upper middle class shouldnt restrain from having children because yours are gonna be yours are gonna be .
*MOT: but they should .
*MOT: because Prs are .
*FAT: yeah .
*FAT: I mean thats the obvious implication .
*MOT: it is .
*MOT: its true .
*FAT: which which strikes me as ya know elitist in the extreme .
*MOT: well it is .
*MOT: youre quite right .
*MOT: it makes her so obviously contented .
*MOT: that .
*FAT: uhhuh .
*MOT: may explain why she has so much trouble getting along with the people she .
*MOT: hasta deal with .
*CHI: I wanna fix my xxx .
*MOT: I hate to say that I go both ways .
*MOT: not so much on the issue of of um .
*MOT: having more than two but when I talk to her Im she or somebody like her and they say you should have more .
