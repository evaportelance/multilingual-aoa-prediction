*MOT: with all the things that you can do the circus is the place for you .
*MOT: yes this is where I wanna be .

*MOT: I like the two little kids in this book Daniel .
*MOT: there really instrumental in getting this catlike thing to be where he wants to go .
*MOT: heehee .
*MOT: I like that .
*EXP: what do you think Daniel liked playing with the most today ?
*MOT: well he is liking the keys right now .
*MOT: he he loves this book at home .
*MOT: he will I dont know pick it up all the time .
*MOT: and he laughs a lot .
*MOT: and he likes books with the well he likes anything with different textures .
*MOT: I thought he would grab one of these out of my hands but he did not .
*EXP: the one with the animals ?
*EXP: do you think hes familar with any of the ones .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: none of them even remotely like anything we have at home .
*MOT: so thats probably it too .
*MOT: the keys we have keys at home so .
*MOT: but not there different .
*EXP: how about the um names of any of the animals ?
*EXP: do you think xxx .
*MOT: I dont think he would know .
*MOT: maybe maybe uh .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: I dont think he would know any of theses .
*MOT: maybe a chicken .
*MOT: he might say that occasionally .
*MOT: certainly not an otter .
*MOT: there are two otters .
*EXP: um what about uh so the books at home .
*MOT: yeah we have we have these two .
*MOT: and plenty others .
*MOT: we we read a lot so .
*MOT: he tries to .
*MOT: I dunno .
*MOT: he likes to pick up books and eat them anyway .
*MOT: I dont know if he actually cares about words but .
*MOT: he really likes to pick up that book .
*EXP: Im sorry ?
*MOT: well he likes to pick up books anyway .
*MOT: and his favorite book at home is yellow also .
*EXP: does he do you read a lot of DoctorSeuss in particular .
*MOT: we just read whatever we have .
*MOT: though he does like this book a great deal .
*MOT: sometimes he laughs just on the first page .
*EXP: do you think he knows what is it called ?
*EXP: Mistermoo ?
*MOT: MisterBrown can moo can you ?
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: so you do all the sounds when you go through it .
*MOT: anytime that I do like animal noises he laughs .
*MOT: well not any kind anymore .
*MOT: now hes more particular hell only laugh at the really funny ones but .
*MOT: did you just spit up Dan ?
*MOT: alright .
*MOT: hold on a second let me get something .
*MOT: but yes he he likes hearing animal noises .
*MOT: I think its just because its mom and dad making sounds that we dont usually make that he knows were not sposta make .
*MOT: that he recognizes as not normal .
*EXP: do you think you played um similar to how you would at home ?
*MOT: maybe .
*MOT: he was completely uninterested in all this stuff .
*MOT: he didnt even look at it which was kinda weird .
*MOT: usually if theres an array of toys like this at home he would be diving into four different ones so .
*MOT: I usually wouldnt offer him that many at once .
*MOT: just because it would because he wouldnt focus on any one thing he would just dive into every separate thing .
*EXP: so he wasnt interested did he play with the food ?
*MOT: he didnt even look at it .
*MOT: like its all within the reach .
*MOT: I mean he you see he was able to reach over and grab the books .
*MOT: and could easily reach forward and grab those I know he can .
*MOT: but he didnt even like look at them .
*EXP: at home ?
*MOT: we dont have any of this stuff at home yet .
*EXP: does he play more at home books than toys ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: hell play with whatever hes got in the room .
*MOT: kind of considers these as his toys also but like .
*MOT: he has I dunno balls and blocks .
*MOT: trains and things .
*MOT: he does have some stuffed animals .
*MOT: they just dont look like these .
*EXP: alright .
*MOT: about the right size though .
*MOT: we do have a couple puppets .
*MOT: but we havent gotten them out yet .
*EXP: uh what parts of the story .
*EXP: oh you said it was the sound effects ?
*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: and then um .
*MOT: and the books that have textures .
*MOT: hes just discovering that he can touch the textures .
*MOT: he likes that .
*EXP: do you think he recognizes any of the names of the animals in the book on the farm ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: maybe maybe once hes actually seen some of the animals in person but .
*MOT: I dont think he recognizes them .
*MOT: I think he yeah like I said he recognizes that the sounds are not sounds that people make .
*EXP: Mhmm .
*MOT: and so in that sense he knows that there funny .
*EXP: did he wanna play with the baby doll today or ?
*MOT: I dont know if hes ever even seen one .
*MOT: I mean we dont have siblings and we only have enough toys for his appropriate age .
*MOT: so I dont think .
*MOT: hes just never seen one that I can think of .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: so his favorite thing uh I think I heard you say was were the books right today ?
*EXP: or the keys you said .
*MOT: well yeah right now I would go back to the books .
*MOT: we have that book at home too .
*MOT: the foot book .
*EXP: and his least favorite thing ?
*MOT: well I tried even this I tried to pass him this .
*MOT: stuffed animals I would say actually .
*MOT: the stuffed animals would hafta be least favorite .
*EXP: least favorite today ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: there he goes going towards the food .
*MOT: ahhah .
*MOT: yellow I think that he likes yellow .
*EXP: its fuzzy .
*EXP: so it could be you know um colors and sounds .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: alright .
*MOT: could also just be things hes able to pick up .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: anything he can put in his mouth right ?
