*MOT: I think that probably was .
*MOT: the good the good one haha .
*EXP: in uh which of the which of the toys um that you played with do you think that she had the least interest in ?
*MOT: I guess .
*MOT: well today some of the books which .
*MOT: I dunno she didnt seem to be too into the books and then the foods .
*MOT: just shes not I mean we dont have anything like that we have spoons like she eats with but we dont have toy foods at home so .
