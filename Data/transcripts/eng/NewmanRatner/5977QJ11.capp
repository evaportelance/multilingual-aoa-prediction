*EXP: oh so she remembers the bottle ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but I th I think its because it is a bottle .
*MOT: youknow ?
*MOT: um that she grabs gravitates towards that .
*MOT: and then like all the food toys this time she was putting in her mouth .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: um like in th in the first thing she picked up when we came in was the peas .
*MOT: and last time she was attracted to the peas as well .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: this time I showed her to clap the um the blocks .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: to she sa saw that it made a sound .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: you like that ?
*MOT: so then she was doing it .
*MOT: and then with the circular cylinder shaped blocks .
*MOT: but then she picked up the pizza and she noticed there was more pizza over there so she went to go get all of them .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: and then she started to shh tap the pizza together to see if she could make the sound with the pizza but .
*MOT: youknow its like she picked it she saw it like made a beeline for it and then came back and then she looked and saw that there was more so um .
*MOT: all of the food stuff .
*MOT: the waffle she put in her mouth .
*MOT: the icecream I said because we ju we her sister just had an icecream cone .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: and so maybe youknow she recognized that .
*MOT: but she I said icecream and she went to go put it in her mouth .
*MOT: um we took tried to take it the real icecream away from her and she had a fit .
*MOT: so maybe she remembered that youknow the icecream experience from the other day .
*EXP: she still eating it .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: this one is .
*MOT: I joke and say its her favorite toy because she hates this thing .
*MOT: I mean like .
*MOT: xxx dont .
*MOT: it is so funny the reaction she gives when like she thinks .
*MOT: but then she was getting brave today .
*MOT: she came and sat on me and she actually pulled it .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: but then when I go to put it next to her shes she makes a fit .
*MOT: she doesnt like it .
*EXP: does she know what thats called ?
*MOT: a bee .
*EXP: mhm she knows xxx .
*MOT: I dont know if she knows a bee .
*MOT: no I think what it is is this these things .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: they look alive .
*MOT: she doesnt like it .
*MOT: we have a Kooshball at home too that she does not like .
*MOT: and her sister doesnt .
*MOT: I play tricks on both of them and put it ne close to them .
*MOT: they realize its there and they take off running .
*MOT: but she does not this thing right here is not her favorite .
*MOT: clearly its not her favorite .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and clearly she doesnt like .
*MOT: because she even jumps if it she thinks its co going to her .
*MOT: see ?
*MOT: you see her face ?
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: shes like get that thing away from me .
*MOT: she doesnt like it .
*EXP: she likes that ?
*MOT: the sp well she just picked the spoon up .
*MOT: the whole time she didnt .
*MOT: even the measuring spoons .
*MOT: and then I use these too when cooking youknow so .
*EXP: so she she knows it ?
*MOT: she probably yeah its like whatever theyre just spoons .
*MOT: but um I just noticed this time .
*MOT: she didnt last time I was trying to get her to clap the blocks and she didnt do it .
*MOT: but this time I did it and she wanted to do it as well so she liked the blocks .
*MOT: the baby and youknow she plays with the babies .
*MOT: we have several babies at home .
*MOT: different ethnicity uh babies as well .
*MOT: and she she just throws them about .
*MOT: I mean youknow its no big no big love affair that she has with the babies .
*MOT: but and then a plethora of stuffed animals so maybe the toys the stuffed animals um she so too familiar with them shes like oh I can play with those at home I dont wanna play with those .
*MOT: I have these food type blocks and toys and um she does have a play bottle at home its muc its a little smaller than that one .
*MOT: and she does the same thing .
*MOT: she puts it straight to her mouth like shes gonna feed herself .
*MOT: um and of course she sees this and automatically knows its a cup .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and she we Im trying to stop her from breastfeeding now .
*MOT: but um um shes been more taken more to the bottle and to cups .
*MOT: and and she wants to drink out of what you have .
*MOT: so maybe this is because even though its smaller and its clearly a toy .
*MOT: maybe its because its familiar with her at home of drinking out of the maybe shes familiar with it youknow from home from drinking out of it at home .
*EXP: was there anything else that she liked to play with ?
*EXP: it looked like she preferred the toys over the books .
*MOT: she de I tried to read her we tried to get her like to look at the books even the peekaboo book which the last time she at least I could get her to look and and then for a quick youknow couple of seconds .
*MOT: but this time she didnt even wanna look at it .
*MOT: she wasnt wasnt even bothered .
*MOT: but it looked like she was gonna turn the page help me turn the pages of this book here .
*MOT: but then she got bored really quickly .
*MOT: and its its crazy because we read books everyday at home .
*MOT: and not little books but like big picture books and youknow .
*MOT: goodnightbear and things like that .
*MOT: she enjoys sitting .
*MOT: and I dont know maybe its because of uh her sister .
*MOT: she has we have a three year old at home .
*MOT: so um and Micah is definitely trying to learn how to read .
*MOT: but uh and Quinn because she just is trying to emulate her sister .
*MOT: maybe its why .
