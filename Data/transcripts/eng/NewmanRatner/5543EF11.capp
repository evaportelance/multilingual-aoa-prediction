*MOT: I dont know if she had a particular last time I cant remember .
*MOT: and she always likes stuffed animals .
*MOT: and shes been playing a lot more with her books at home .

*MOT: thats why I put that up .
*MOT: she was gonna rip that one .

*MOT: thats why she we have two like that one and thats why I picked xxx I knew shed like that she plays .
*MOT: she will go through her bin at home and pull that like theres toys and stuff but shell pull that book out .
*MOT: because of the .
*MOT: she can feel everything .
*MOT: juice ?
*MOT: you didnt see that one huh ?
*MOT: and everything must go in her mouth .
*EXP: thats xxx .
*EXP: um let me think .
*EXP: does she eat any of those foods ?
*MOT: um y she I mean she li she will have pizza but yeah .
*MOT: I havent really ventured out much more than .
*MOT: basic foods with her so .
*EXP: does she do you think she recognizes it or no ?
*EXP: no I think it was just the right size to go into her mouth and the right youknow .
*MOT: plastic chewing .
*MOT: but the um baby bottle she recognized because she right away and tha the juice cup right there which shes play with now but yeah she knew that this was a youknow a bottle .
*EXP: do you have a babydoll at home ?
*MOT: she has soft babydolls .

*MOT: no shes never .
*MOT: I Im laughing because we have a lit she has a walker thing thats a stroller .
*MOT: and we put the babydoll in there but li she prefers to walk the dish towel .
*MOT: so she will grab the dish towel and put it over the .
*MOT: so I dont think she knows or her she has like a little um stuffed rabbit .
*MOT: thats like a little blank and shell walk that .
*MOT: but thats what she sleeps with every night so thats her connection .
