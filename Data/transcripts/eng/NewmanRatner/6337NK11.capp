*EXP: mkay .
*EXP: gonna ask you some questions .
*EXP: alright so what do you think his favorite toy was this time ?
*MOT: besides the camera and the cord um .
*MOT: I think the sippycup and the spoon were the two that he seemed to play with the most .
*EXP: why do you think so ?
*MOT: I think hes hungry .
*MOT: its hes ready for lunch .
*EXP: gotcha .
*MOT: he always tries to take the spoon out of my hand and play with it and then and hes he hasnt had anything to drink in a little bit so hes probably just hungry and thirsty .
*EXP: do you think he recognizes those things ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: yes definitely .
*MOT: I bet alot of it he probably doesnt recognize but the sippycup and the spoon and the bottle .
*MOT: I think he definitely does .
*MOT: and he loved the icecream cones last time and this time and so I dont know if he recognizes them or not or if he just likes to chew on them .
*MOT: you know what I mean like he likes the shape of them or whatever so .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: because we dont usually get this kind of cone .
*MOT: but .
*EXP: hm .
*MOT: hm .
*MOT: so yeah he always hes always always gravitates towards plastic toys hes never been into the stuffed animals hell play with books at home .
*MOT: mostly to take them off the shelf and throw them but .
*MOT: the stuffed animals hes never interested in .
*EXP: mkay .
*EXP: so you think he recognizes any of the food then besides the xxx ?
*MOT: maybe the pizza .
*MOT: and the cheese .
*MOT: yeah ?
*MOT: Im gonna say thats probably I dont know thats probably about it .
*EXP: so what did he like last time you said the icecream .
*MOT: the icecream cones .
*MOT: the icecream cones and the icecream sundae well and he might and you know what he might recognize those like thats been one of his favorite things lately is when we eat icecream he loves to have some .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: so I think yeah maybe he might recognize the icecream .
*MOT: and that doesnt really look like pasta so I dont know if hed recognize that .
*EXP: I agree .
*MOT: maybe the bread .
*MOT: hes weve started giving him bread lately .
*EXP: so .
*EXP: do you think he recognizes any of the stuffed animals ?
*MOT: I dont think so Imean we read books and talk youknow Ill point out animals and stuff he doesnt seem to be real engaged .
*MOT: he likes to play with those little farm toys but he doesnt real interest like he doesnt seem real interested in stuffed animals and so its hard to tell .
*MOT: he likes when we make noises and stuff but then hes like kinda done with it .
*EXP: right so .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and I think he likes to play with the eyes on the doll .
*MOT: which makes me nervous because my sisters getting ready to have a baby .
*MOT: and hell poke the baby in the eye .
*EXP: oh man .
*MOT: thats why I always try to treat dolls like real kids .
*MOT: huh .
*EXP: hi .
*EXP: hows that spoon ?
*MOT: say it better food on it .
*EXP: yeah you are hungry .
*MOT: and hes still teething so he has no teeth yet so he chews on anything he can get in his mouth .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: and I think thats part of the reason he likes to play with the pla the hard toys compared to the soft toys .
*MOT: because hes never played with soft toys .
*EXP: oh that makes sense .
*MOT: gentle Nathan remember ?
*MOT: look gentle thereyougo good job .
*MOT: not in the eye though .
*MOT: youre a good listener .
*EXP: do you um use alot of words of encouragement when he does something right or .
*MOT: yeah Imean I try to I try to .
*MOT: unfortunately youknow most of the time he ends up going for the outlet or the video camera or the cord or the youknow so he spends alot of time doing that so yeah Ill we we try to look out for that and and do as much words of encouragement as we can .
*EXP: does he gravitate towards toys that make noise ?
*MOT: he likes them um but thats not like the only hell play with like .
*MOT: we try youknow and its funny because I think when I think about it I think all of our noise making toys are in one room and like all of his other toys you know what I mean and like not on purpose I think thats just how it worked out but .
*MOT: Nathan no .
*MOT: and youre gonna try to cr crawl climb up that arent you ?
*MOT: come here come see Mama .
*MOT: Im gonna get you .
*EXP: ooh .
*MOT: good boy .
*MOT: um he does like he does like toys that make noise but .
*MOT: like theres some toys when we turn them off he enjoys them just as much when theyre not making noise so he likes to play with alot of stuff that doesnt make noise too .
*MOT: so its probably half and half .
*EXP: so do you think he um likes certain toys certain colors or textures ?
*MOT: definitely like hard plastic better than like soft stuff .
*MOT: Im trying to think if weve got like wood toys or anything like that .
*MOT: he definitely likes bumpy stuff um if somethings got like a youknow some kind of pattern texture on it he likes that .
*MOT: Im trying to think of what else .
*MOT: Nathan .
*MOT: stop .
*MOT: yeah I think that thats probably the most of it and he likes he likes chewing on board books he likes chewing on paper he loves chewing on paper .
*MOT: thats always a challenge because he tries to choke on that too .
*MOT: but yeah I think mostly just the the harder toys and then if theres like a bumpy some soft of bumpy texture on it he likes that .
*MOT: basically anything that feels good on his gums .
*MOT: is is really wants to but hes started like he has a shape sorter at home .
*MOT: and he loves playing with that and he started putting shapes into the box and trying to put it through the right holes .
*MOT: he never quite gets them the right direction but like hell put the circle over the circle hole and .
*MOT: youknow and so I think hes starting to get that like different shapes and and stuff like that hes starting to learn that .
*MOT: and hes figured out he loves um he has a little people barn and like theres certain doors that open and close that make noises and stuff and he loves moving hes figured out how to move all the things that makes noise and he likes to do that .
*EXP: thats really good .
*MOT: then he also likes to just carry the little people around with him and chew on them and whatever .
*MOT: yeah and hell put like hell definitely put stuff in and take stuff out of of buckets and hes got a train thats got like the balls that come out of the top and hell grab them and hell put them back in and .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: he the the the the putting in and taking out has been his latest favorite thing to do .
*EXP: oh I wanted to ask if you remember what his favorite toy was on the first visit .
*MOT: the first visit he was just kinda playing with all of the food toys .
*MOT: and I think it was like I dont know if it was this one but it was like one of these like I think rectangular kind of things .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: maybe like this one because he was probably smaller then .
*MOT: but yeah it was just I think it was one of these little things I dont know .
*MOT: yeah I think it was just one of these .
*MOT: ooh you know actually you know what it was it was I think there was like a can of peas or maybe this .
*MOT: I think this like one of these things .
*EXP: uhoh .
*EXP: oh good .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: so hes been consistent with the food .
*MOT: just xxx on .
*MOT: and I think now hes starting to recognize more of it too since hes eating more like real food .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: alright .
*MOT: he definitely gets excited when we get when we pull a cracker out like he recognizes the package of crackers .
*MOT: and hes like like I was putting it in the diaper bag earlier and I thought he was gonna jump out of his skin and then hes like what youre not giving me one ?
*EXP: uhuh .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: thats funny .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: alright so thats all the questions I have .
*MOT: and then he doesnt come back until hes two or something right ?
