*MOT: there .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: there .
*EXP: that was a pretty quick turn around .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: get a distraction in there .
*EXP: so um are any of these toys ones that you actually have at home ?
*EXP: that shes particulary familiar with already or ?
*MOT: um the food .
*MOT: um you want in particular ?
*EXP: in general .
*MOT: uh like the peas .
*MOT: we have these the same exact peas at home .
*MOT: um some of the plates .
*MOT: I dunno if shell go after those .
*EXP: I take it theyre for her sister .
*MOT: the spoons yeah .
*MOT: she has an older sister .
*MOT: and then she has some stuffed animals .
*MOT: although she has lots of stuffed animals .
*MOT: I dont think shes ever played with a baby doll before .
*MOT: and then you know we read her books .
*MOT: but nothing .
*MOT: Isabel not in your mouth .
*MOT: but not um .
*EXP: we clean them after each baby so .
*MOT: okay well thats not too bad then .
*MOT: um I dont think we have these exact books .
*MOT: but um .
*EXP: you commented that good night moon was the new one so I was thinking .
*MOT: oh yeah the numbers .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I havent seen the number good night moon before .
*MOT: we have the original .
*EXP: xxx most people have .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: does she actually play with the food items ?
*EXP: or is it mostly just that her sister does and theyre in the house ?
*MOT: no shell play with them .
*MOT: but she just kind of handles them .
*MOT: and looks at them and .
*MOT: goes on to the next .
*EXP: are there particular toys that you think match her personality better ?
*EXP: that she tends to go for or tends to be more interested in as a general class ?
*MOT: um ones that light up and play music .
*MOT: seem to be those seem to get her attention the most .
*MOT: or anything she can put in her mouth .
*EXP: thats pretty typical .
*MOT: but yeah .
*EXP: why did you pick the particular stuffed animals that you did out of all of them ?
*EXP: cause you di yo you were choosing among them .
*MOT: yeah um the brighter colored ones .
*MOT: I just thought they would you know especially with the hair .
*MOT: here with the different material .
*MOT: that would get her attention a little more .
*MOT: but definitely the brighter colors .
*MOT: xxx something to kind of attract her attention .
*EXP: but you picked the chicken .
*MOT: the chicken .
*MOT: yeah well then I started going with the animal sounds .
*MOT: thinking that she might enjoy or .
*MOT: its harder to really teach her anything at this point but .
*MOT: xxx you know .
*MOT: get them started early with the animal sounds .
*EXP: are there particular games you tend to play with her ?
*MOT: peekaboo .
*MOT: this is one of them .
*MOT: um thats pretty much I think thats the only game I can think of that we play with her .
*MOT: and we tickle her .
*MOT: um but yeah I think probably peekaboo is the only that she can really identify with .
*EXP: xxx just a second .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: uh which of these do you think she liked the least of all the things you played with xxx ?
*MOT: uh xxx the stuffed animals .
*MOT: or no the clock actually .
*MOT: she didnt have any interest in the clock .
*EXP: you mentioned Frio is Frio a ?
*MOT: oh yeah its my parents poodle .
*MOT: she sees Frio probably a few times a week .
*MOT: but its a black poodle .
*EXP: does it have the the french ?
*MOT: yeah yes yes .
*MOT: but I don I she probably couldnt identify with that .
*EXP: xxx probably not .
*EXP: um in general does she tend to prefer books or toys ?
*MOT: toys .
*MOT: Id say toys for sure .
*MOT: I mean with books shell just eat she wants to put them in her mouth .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: and whats is there a favorite book that you actually tend to read her a lot of the ones at home ?
*EXP: or is it just whatever ?
*MOT: no its probably whatever were reading to her sister .
*MOT: is what shes gonna to be listening to .
*MOT: so theyre probably um xxx right a right along this line .
*MOT: maybe a little more advanced .
*MOT: yeah if only that was real .
*MOT: yes if only .
*EXP: um anything in particular that you think I should be asking and Im not ?
*EXP: about what things she likes and what things she doesnt .
*EXP: or anything else you can tell me .
*MOT: about like playing habits ?
*EXP: yes just playing habits .
*MOT: I think you know having an older sister really gears her .
*MOT: you know her sister gears her more towards what theyre going to be playing with .
*MOT: you know shell pick up Isabel and put her in front of the kitchen .
*MOT: or put her in front of her stuffed animals .
*MOT: and just start showing her things .
*MOT: so I think thats um thats probably that probably gears her more um for her playing habits .
*MOT: and I dont know we ha we havent done I mean this is this is pretty typical just like kinda putting her in front of a bunch of toys and kinda letting her have at it .
*MOT: um yeah and everything goes in her mouth .
*EXP: at this age that is very difficult .
*MOT: everything goes in .
*MOT: um she has a piano at home .
*MOT: like a little kid little baby piano that she loves to bang on .
*MOT: um and then her seems the other toys that she likes are the bouncy seat .
*MOT: she can jump up and down in that .
*MOT: and yeah anything that lights up and plays music .
*MOT: and she also likes to stand .
*MOT: um like we have a little play table .
*MOT: that she can .
*EXP: that she can stand on .
*MOT: or stand and hold on to yeah .
*MOT: to keep her balance .
*MOT: she really likes to do that .
*MOT: but um yeah she doesnt theres nothing else .
*MOT: other than that .
*MOT: thats pretty much all of her her playing habits .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: well thats all I have for you .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: when she gets a little older were going to come back and do this again .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: at which point one of the questions will be things like what has changed .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: like if she suddenly got some more interests or if she started liking different toys .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah hopefully .
*MOT: but at some point shell be moving around a little more .
*EXP: theres not necessarily any right answer like some kids tend to be more into st like some kids are just really into stuffed animals .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and some kids are like well all I care about is things I can put in my mouth and some kids are .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yep .
*MOT: so heres .
*EXP: let me take that from you .
*MOT: here you go .
