*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: um right now we are living with my mom .

*MOT: and she is super cook .
*MOT: so I think that he has really noticed all of that .

*MOT: and I mean at home he has different kinds of toys .
*MOT: but this is something Imean I would have thought I would have picked the animals .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: uh but the food stuff he really seemed to take a shine to .
*EXP: oh thats neat and hes been over there working on it .
*MOT: for a long time .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: you know putting things places and kind of organizing it .
*MOT: xxx usually he just throws things around so this is interesting its kind of a new new thing .
*EXP: he seems very busy are there any food items that he plays with that you think he recognizes ?

*MOT: oh yeah .
*MOT: I mean right he said xxx that lump of something I think he called it cheese .

*MOT: so .
*EXP: are there any of them that you think were new ?
*EXP: that you .
*MOT: I dont think he knows what this is .
*MOT: and theres some that I think are xxx deconstructed like you know the hamburger thing I dont think he necessarily knows what that is cause .
*MOT: we dont really give him sandwiches so much .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so but he might know what it is because we eat it .
*MOT: um xxx recognize things were dessert .
*MOT: versus regular food .
*MOT: which is interesting because we dont give him all that many sweets .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so oh cookie .
*MOT: xxx or that he picked those little cupcakes .
*EXP: yeah that was interesting huh ?
*EXP: um how about with the animals are there any that are favorites of his ?
*MOT: um well the kangaroo .
*MOT: um he has a stuffed kangaroo so he really likes the xxx I think its one of his favorites .

*MOT: and the warthog but we didnt really play with him .
*MOT: play with him .
*MOT: a lot of these would be new to him .
*MOT: but we didnt really go go to them but some of them were pretty familiar .
