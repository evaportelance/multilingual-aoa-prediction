*MOT: yeah he likes to .
*MOT: like he with the screwdriver .

*EXP: does he have any animals like this at home ?

*MOT: we dont have anything like that .
*MOT: like the closest things we would hafta like animals would be .
*MOT: like in his books like we talked about .
*MOT: in his books .
*MOT: or like maybe .
*MOT: we have a handful of stuffed animals .
*MOT: but theyre mostly all teddy bears .
*MOT: like we have like a horse and a giraffe .
*MOT: but very very few of those .
*MOT: yeah we dont have anything like this .
*MOT: he plays a lot of cars and trucks .
*MOT: thats what he likes .
*MOT: thats what works .
*MOT: we dont have any dolls .
*MOT: at all .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: um so yeah .
*MOT: everytime weve been and theyve had dolls .
*MOT: hes showed no interest .
*MOT: because he doesnt have dolls .
*MOT: he doesnt play with dolls .
*MOT: so itll be interesting to see now that we have a little girl .
*MOT: well have dolls in the house Im sure .
*MOT: to see if he plays with his little sisters dolls .
*MOT: thatll be interesting to see .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: he probably will .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: I know my brother loved playing with my toys xxx .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and I would take his like GIJoes .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um do you think he recognized would have recognized .
*EXP: any of these animals ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: I think had we come over and played with them .
*MOT: had I been able to take him away from the kitchen .
*MOT: then he yeah he wouldve recognized um .
*MOT: some of them .
*MOT: maybe not all of them .
*MOT: but some of them .
*MOT: he does more animal sounds .
*MOT: than naming the animals .
*MOT: thats a lobster .
*MOT: theyre delicious .
*EXP: has he ever been to a zoo or anything like that ?
*EXP: or a farm ?
*MOT: he has been to .
*MOT: a farm .

*MOT: and animals you find in the home .
*MOT: like mice .
*MOT: and all those kind of things .
*MOT: um so mostly animals and he gets from books .
*MOT: and and from tv .
*MOT: weve the tv is on .
*MOT: I filled that out on the sheet .
*MOT: its on almost all day .
*MOT: because I just I watch a lot of tv .
*MOT: and now that I have the baby .
*MOT: thats one of the only things that will keep him preoccupied .
*MOT: so that I can deal with the baby .
*MOT: like when Im nursing the baby I need him to not get into things .
*MOT: he normally does an excellent job of playing by himself .
*MOT: but .
*MOT: we have those times where I hafta put the tv on as a babysitter .
*MOT: because it keeps him occupied so .
*MOT: he watches a lot of tv um .
*MOT: even when hes playing hell play .

*MOT: he loves books .
*MOT: he reads with daddy every night before bed .

*MOT: and he pulls it out when its done .
*MOT: so yeah .
*MOT: he really likes to help .
*MOT: and .
*MOT: when I start to do something .
*MOT: usually its for him .
*MOT: like if Im getting his lunch .
*MOT: or his snack .
*MOT: he he comes in and says help I wanna help .
*MOT: and so I hafta .
*MOT: hell point to the chair .
*MOT: because I bring a chair into the kitchen .
*MOT: so he can climb up on the chair and watch what Im doing .
*MOT: with washing the berries or whatever Im doing .
*MOT: so he wants to hes a big helper lately .
*MOT: so thats kind of fun and exciting .
*MOT: but I dont do a whole lot of cooking .
*MOT: my husband is the cook .
*MOT: um so .
*MOT: and usually .
*MOT: hes starting to eat his dinner .
*MOT: when were getting our dinner together .
*MOT: and then we kind of all sit down and kind of eat together .
*MOT: since he eats he takes his time obviously .
*MOT: when hes eating .
*MOT: um so yeah I am not in the kitchen a whole lot .
*MOT: actually like cooking .
*MOT: but theres been a handful of times .
*MOT: when Ive been in there doing it that Ive asked just to keep him .
*MOT: busy ?
*MOT: like hey do you wanna help mommy ?
*MOT: and hell come help me stir the soup or whatever Im cooking .
*MOT: and um .

*EXP: and then I mean thats good to if he wants to help with the baby .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yeah hes good about like if I ask him to go get her pacifier .
*MOT: or go get her blanket or whatever .
*MOT: hes good about .
*MOT: the burp cloth thats the .
*MOT: I forgot the burp cloth .
*MOT: can you go get me the burp cloth ?
*MOT: and he runs and gets the burp cloth .
*MOT: and brings it back .
*MOT: so hes a good helper .
*EXP: aw good brother .
*MOT: yes yes .
*MOT: oh good job Aidan .
*MOT: so yeah .
*EXP: so you feel like so you were saying like with the um .
*EXP: like the infants and toddlers xxx he understands a lot ?
*MOT: he understands a lot .
*MOT: but he doesnt articulate .
*MOT: and I dont know if its .
*MOT: I think I think .
*MOT: partially its .
*MOT: hes he takes after me in that hes a perfectionist .
*MOT: and I think part of it is he knows in his head .
*MOT: I I think hes not getting it out right .
*MOT: like he starts to say like a lot of the times hell whisper .
*MOT: like the first time he starts to say something hell whisper it .
*MOT: like .
*MOT: does that sound right ?
*MOT: and if it sounds somewhat right .
*MOT: hell say it again .
*MOT: but if it doesnt hes like no thats not right .
*MOT: ya know .
*MOT: so hes very .
*MOT: cautious I guess in his speech .
*MOT: of thats not right .
*MOT: I dont wanna say it unless thats right .
*MOT: um so I think thats part of it .
*MOT: and I think part of it too is just .
*MOT: is just delayed .
*MOT: and so hes definitely starting to talk .
*MOT: hes much more vocal and verbal now than he was six months ago .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: its definitely its definitely helping .
*MOT: and maybe its just timing of things too .
*MOT: but um .
*MOT: but hes getting a lot better .
*MOT: but yeah he understands he understands a ton .
*MOT: like I was even amazed with the pictures .
*MOT: and things that he was pointing out .
*MOT: I was like I didnt know you knew that .
*MOT: haha its like he knows so much more than I thought he did .
*MOT: but he doesnt say it .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: and theres things that hell say .
*MOT: but Ive only heard him say it like twice .
*MOT: you know ?
*MOT: like I know he knows that word .
*MOT: but hes only said it a couple of times .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: its always interesting filling out those surveys .
*MOT: of well does it count ?
*MOT: hes said it once .
*MOT: I know hes said it .
*MOT: he doesnt say it all the time but .
*EXP: yeah sometimes he like .
*EXP: especially with the pictures .
*EXP: they might know it in like the context .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: of like their house .
*EXP: or whatever hes useta seeing it within the picture xxx .
*MOT: it looks different .
*MOT: or yeah .
*EXP: so some parents are surprised like I thought he knew that .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: but its just it could just be .
*EXP: you know its just a new context or something .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: like with the body parts I thought that was xxx .
*MOT: because he knows all of his body parts on him .
*MOT: but to point at it on a picture .
*MOT: was I think a little difficult for him .
*MOT: like thats not my toes .
*MOT: you know hes like .
*MOT: I dont know what that is but my toes are right here .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: um is there ?
*EXP: was this kind of typical of the other play sessions ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yup .
*MOT: he always gravitated towards .
*MOT: the food items .
*MOT: because again its new and different .
*MOT: and nothing like we have at home .
*MOT: and other times there were like a bunch of books .
*MOT: and he was never interested .
*MOT: like nope Im too busy doing this to read books .
*MOT: like Im not in that mood .
*MOT: um and like I said the dolls .
*MOT: he never even went near the dolls .
*MOT: I was trying to xxx I think one time I there was a doll .
*MOT: with a bottle .
*MOT: and I was trying to feed the baby the bottle .
*MOT: and he was completely confused .
*MOT: because I breast feed .
*MOT: and so he was like what is that ?
*MOT: and I kind of thought that was hilarious .
*MOT: I was like he doesnt even know what this is .
*MOT: so hes like ah I dont know .
*MOT: yeah because he .
*MOT: I weaned .
*MOT: he wasnt weaned until he was sixteen months .
*MOT: so yeah thats that was all he knew .
*MOT: he didnt have a bottle very often .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: so yeah this was very typical of the other play sessions .
*MOT: that we had gravitated on this side .
*MOT: with all that stuff .
*EXP: and you said um hes he was more independent ?
*EXP: or hes becoming more independent now .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: and in in the other sessions was he more kind of like .
*EXP: you hadta name things for him and do things ?
*MOT: um yeah .
*MOT: I was doing a lot of .
*MOT: narrating .
*MOT: I guess .
*MOT: what he was doing .
*MOT: I still I think I still do that but Im more aware .
*MOT: of it now .
*MOT: just from things that Ive learned .
*MOT: from the class that Im taking or whatever .
*MOT: but yeah it was kind of like I was watching him play .
*MOT: and would narrate what he was doing .
*MOT: and I still do that a little .
*MOT: yeah because he just he wasnt saying anything .
*MOT: so its like well .
*MOT: I can at least make sure Im naming things .
*MOT: so that hes soaking it all in on what these things are .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: so yeah .
*EXP: Im not familiar with the class .
*EXP: like is it just like they are teaching you like ?
*MOT: um its .
*MOT: yeah theyre teaching us techniques .
*MOT: and tips and tools .
*MOT: to .
*MOT: its basically to get the child to initiate the conversation .
*MOT: so that as opposed to .
*MOT: saying .
*MOT: like a lot of what we did today .
*MOT: the can you say this ?
*MOT: and I know thats for purely testing purposes .
*MOT: but theyre telling us not to do that .
*MOT: that just to keep repeating the word .
*MOT: like if I was trying to get him to say cup .
*MOT: instead of saying can you say cup ?
*MOT: I would just say cup .
*MOT: cup .
*MOT: and kind of wait for him to say it back .
*MOT: and now that hes at a point where hes um .
*MOT: more of a .
*MOT: between a first word user .
*MOT: and a combiner of words .
*MOT: hes kind of getting more into that .
*MOT: I dont do as much of that as I do waiting for him to say it .
*MOT: if I know like I know .
*MOT: he says cup everyday thousands of times a day .
*MOT: so I would just hand this to him and wait .
*MOT: for him to identify it .
*MOT: so I dont know .
*MOT: its um .
*MOT: I think its a Canadian .
*MOT: I think the authors I think theyre Canadian .
*MOT: but yeah its this whole program .
*MOT: and its like six weeks long .
*MOT: and they come and do videotape sessions in between .
*MOT: um to kind of mark their progress .
*MOT: and then we he when were done with the class .
*MOT: theyll reevaluate him to see if he needs to continue on with .
*MOT: the typical home visits with the infants and toddlers program .
*MOT: or if hell be caught up by then .
*MOT: so Ill be really curious to see how that .
*MOT: how that goes .
*MOT: because we had him evaluated at he was twenty one months .
*MOT: and they evaluated him at about a twelve month level .
*MOT: as far as his um language .
*MOT: but developmentally and socially .
*MOT: he was right where he should have been .
*MOT: but he was just the language delay was the big .
*MOT: the big factor .
*MOT: so Im glad we got involved in the program .
*MOT: just to help help us monitor and help us to be more aware .
*MOT: because we were never too concerned about it .
*MOT: we were aware that like .
*MOT: he just recently just started saying mama .
*MOT: as to call me .
*MOT: like as opposed to thats mama .
*MOT: but hey mama I need this .
*MOT: or mama come get me out of of bed .
*MOT: um he just started doing that just a few months ago .
*MOT: where as all my friends kids were doing that at you know .
*MOT: a year .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: so that was um a big difference .
*MOT: so yeah the class really is its teaching me tools .
*MOT: and theres like work book .
*MOT: and we have homework .
*MOT: and I mean its a class .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: um so yeah its really just all about .
*MOT: kind of observing .
*MOT: like the thing theyve been talking about recently .
*MOT: is the owl concept .
*MOT: to observe wait and listen .
*MOT: which is hard for me to do because I dont .
*EXP: its hard for me too .
*MOT: Im not very patient .
*MOT: but to observe what hes doing and how hes playing .
*MOT: and then .
*MOT: wait for him to start an interaction .
*MOT: with me .
*MOT: and then listening to his lessons .
*MOT: whether theyre verbal .
*MOT: or through sign because he signs .
*MOT: and just kind of you know listening to his messages .
*MOT: and then trying to continue a conversation with him .
*MOT: so thats kind of where we just started it .
*MOT: just a couple of weeks ago .
*MOT: so its still still pretty new .
*MOT: Im finding it really interesting .
*MOT: and Im learning a lot of just basic things .
*MOT: like you know .
*MOT: saying can you say really confuses them .
*MOT: more than just saying the word .
*MOT: because theyre hearing four words before the thing you were asking them to say .
*MOT: Im like well that makes sense actually .
*MOT: you know its like that makes sense .
*MOT: so yeah .
*EXP: thats really cool .
*EXP: yeah I hadnt heard of that .
*EXP: but thats good it gives you something xxx .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: sometimes if youre receiving services its like you wanna know what else you can do too .
*MOT: yeah exactly .
*EXP: when youre not coming in or .
*MOT: exactly .
*MOT: exactly .
*EXP: so thats good .
*EXP: and hes yeah hes very social .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: I mean hes kind quiet but .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: well well send you the results of everything .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: but like with the things in the bag .
*EXP: like those are more like looking his visual um perception .
*EXP: and like um fine motor skills .
*MOT: yup .
*EXP: and all that you know he was doing pretty well with that stuff .
*MOT: yeah .

*MOT: okay .
*EXP: so yeah .
