*MOT: yes .
*MOT: hes hes very interested in everything .
*EXP: yeah well thats great .
*EXP: oh thank you .
*MOT: sorry .
*EXP: um yeah okay .
*EXP: so do you wanna just tell me he started with playing with um today .
*MOT: um immediately went towards the fake food .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and hes done that every single time weve been here .
*MOT: so he loves fake food .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: does he have fake food at home ?
*MOT: um actually no .
*MOT: we dont have any fake food at our house we have a lot of little friends who do have the fake food .
*MOT: um we go to the library sometimes and they have these discovery rooms and they have fake food in there .
*MOT: and he pretends that his other toys are food as well sometimes .
*MOT: so we just decided to let it be a kind of an out of house fun thing so .
*EXP: that makes sense .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um so I guess has he seen any of this food before ?
*MOT: in real life ?
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: yes hes seen most of this food before .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um so uh is there anything he hasnt seen before ?
*MOT: um Im not sure if hes seen um Im not sure if hes seen beets before .
*MOT: um hed never seen a donut he called the donut a bagel because that was his closet frame of reference .
*MOT: but I think for the most .
*MOT: he may not have ever seen sushi before we have a book about sushi though so hes seen it in a book .
*MOT: um but yeah for the most part hes seen all the food here .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: um and you said he does eat some of these foods ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: he eats most of these foods .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: anything he particularly likes ?
*MOT: he really likes icecream he really likes pizza .
*MOT: um in this food group lets see he likes oatmeal .
*MOT: it looks like there was some oatmeal over there .
*MOT: um and cupcakes .
*MOT: hes not a great fan of greenbeans .
*MOT: um yeah hes hes a pretty good eater .
*MOT: so he really likes kiwi he actually went to the kiwis first and knew exactly what they were so .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: he likes those and he likes bananas and cookies and peppers .
*MOT: so yeah .
*MOT: he likes a lot of them .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: alright so I know he played with just about everything so um what was the next thing that he was interested in ?
*MOT: um we kinda came over here and did the puzzle and animals almost kinda simultaneously but um .
*MOT: he we tr Imean I tried to get him interested in this .
*MOT: but then he only was for a a little bit .
*MOT: um I guess I was going for trying to get him to group all the sea animals together but .
*MOT: he was talking about the farmer going swimming so .
*MOT: uh so wasnt that interested .
*MOT: he was a little more interested in the animals we have a set very similar to this at our house um .
*MOT: so he he knows a lot of the animals .
*MOT: and he likes he plays with them a lot at our house .
*MOT: I almost think he plays more with the food when hes here because we dont have it at our house .
*MOT: but .
*EXP: I mean yeah that makes sense .
*MOT: yeah so .
*MOT: yeah he likes animals .
*MOT: he likes puzzles but he didnt quite understand what he could do with this .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: yeah its not a youknow puzzle in the normal sense .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: kind of a xxx .
*MOT: its like a thematic .
*MOT: its an ocean what can you put in the ocean ?
*MOT: I guess there were we didnt get to the different backgrounds .
*MOT: so I didnt get to show him those .
*EXP: um so in terms of the animals were there any that he hadnt seen before ?
*EXP: any new ones ?
*MOT: um I was trying to get him to see the peacock .
*MOT: we a long time ago we did a coloring book with a peacock but it had been a very long time .
*MOT: so I was trying to see if remembered and he didnt say it so I dont know .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but um I was gonna ask him about this one but I cant even remember what this animal is called so I didnt ask him .
*MOT: uh so yeah we dont we dont know what that is .
*MOT: definitely knew moose .
*MOT: um he would know an anteater .
*MOT: a dolphin .
*MOT: yeah most of these most of these he he knows .
*MOT: um he knew the octopus I asked him about the octopus .
*MOT: um he might call this a pig instead of a boar but .
*MOT: but yeah hes hes familiar with most of these animals either from books or possibly seeing them on tv .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um so what else was he interested in today ?
*MOT: uh when we very very first sat down he pulled this dog over and said oh look its a boy .
*MOT: and then he was interested in the eyes of them .
*MOT: he was interested in the the working but then when I was like oh lets dress them he was not interested in dressing them .
*MOT: uh and th but then before we put them down he said well they can go to sleep .
*MOT: so he uh I guess kinda looked at them as if they were babies like okay well put them to sleep and then Im going on to this so .
*MOT: so uh yeah he was only sort of interested in those .
*MOT: but and then back to the food for the cooking .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: uh he asked he asked several times to read GoodnightMoon .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um we didnt make it very far in GoodnightMoon I think just because theres so much else to see and do .
*EXP: I know .
*EXP: um is that a book hes read ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: we have that one pretty much memorized so .
*EXP: um does he have any favorite parts of it ?
*MOT: uh he likes Imean he likes the cow jumping over the moon he likes to he likes to fill in the blanks for the the sentences and then I guess the uh the little old lady whispering hush is always a favorite part for us .
*MOT: so .
*CHI: whats that ?
*MOT: whats that ?
*EXP: um lets see was there anything else he really played with ?
*MOT: um he he liked the bowls a lot he liked taking the different things and putting them in the bowls .
*MOT: um and dumping them out .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: um but yeah I think Imean I think he played just with a little bit of everything .
*MOT: he played a little bit with the stove .
*MOT: Im pretty sure he knows that thats a stove like what we have at home .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: does he like to play with the stove at home ?
*MOT: uh yes .
*MOT: Imean hes ver hes very interested in me cooking and he always wants to help .
*MOT: so we always hafta come up with ways that he can help without getting burned or youknow spilling all over the place hot things .
*MOT: but uh yeah hes uh very interested in the stove and cooking and the chopping and that kind of thing at home so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um was there anything that he usually plays with at home that we didnt have here today ?
*MOT: um puzzles he really really loves puzzles .
*MOT: like th they have the board puzzles that have the different shapes of them where its one shape fits in each one he has a lot of those .
*MOT: and then he also has he also has actual puzzles where you hafta fit the all the pieces together and make a picture .
*MOT: and he likes both he likes puzzles a lot .
*MOT: he really likes musical instruments a lot .
*MOT: he likes drums and shakers and that kinda thing .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um and lets see was there anything you noticed today about his play that was different from either the previous one previous play sessions or anything ?
*MOT: um he he pretends a lot more now .
*MOT: uh before he did shove the food in his mouth but it was just because he shoved everything in his mouth .
*MOT: now hes actually hes wanting to hes pretending hes eating something .
*MOT: he stuck a pot on his head he pretends things are hats .
*MOT: he uses his imagination a lot more than he has on the previous visits so .
*MOT: lets try not to step on the toys baby I know theyre kind of everywhere but .
*MOT: um yeah I think thats the biggest thing is the using the imagination he had a lot more words to tell me what he wanted to play with so kinda even when I would tried and guide him somewhere else he could tell me no I wanna I wanna go to this so .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: so yeah hes .
*MOT: he still has fun .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: alright well I think were just about finished .
*MOT: okay .
