*EXP: is it okay if I ask you some questions now ?
*MOT: sure mhm .
*EXP: um so tell me about how you guys played and what you played with .
*MOT: what we played with ?
*MOT: it looked like she gravitated to the food items and I think because of the colors .
*MOT: she really likes the colors .
*MOT: and maybe the soft texture of it .
*MOT: but it was hard enough to bite on it because shes teething so .
*MOT: she kept going after these little slices of pizza she liked that a lot .
*MOT: um I kept trying to introduce her to the different stuffed toys .
*MOT: she wasnt interested at first .
*MOT: she hadta do that first .
*MOT: and then after a while she was kind of okay with the bumblebee .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and she liked him because he was having interaction with her and kissing her and bumping up against her .
*MOT: and we do that a lot at home with stuffed toys .
*MOT: and we read a lot but she likes to eat the pages so .
*MOT: she got frustrated with me .
*MOT: because she wasnt able to eat the page .
*MOT: and that you saw she was getting a little fussy because of that .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but normally we do .
*MOT: we sing the abc song like all day long .
*MOT: so shes familiar with that when she hears it .
*MOT: she hops her head up .
*MOT: and sometimes she plays in her uh play pen at home .
*MOT: and I just throw a bunch of things in there and she just kinda plays with them independently .
*MOT: so Im useta shes not useta me playing like this much with her this long .
*MOT: because I think I I com Im irritating her a little bit .
*MOT: shed rather just do her own thing .
*MOT: thats kinda her personality .
*EXP: are any of the food items familiar um things from home ?
*MOT: they have playfood at home its not these items specifically .
*MOT: but she doesnt really play with those because theyre in our play room and shes too small to really go in there so I dont she may have seen them before though .
*MOT: but she doesnt theyre not the same stuff .
*MOT: theyre a little harder .
*MOT: theyre more like this .
*MOT: the plastic one .
*MOT: theyre thicker .
*EXP: do you use some of the names at home ?
*EXP: um the names of the food at home ?
*MOT: pizza mhm .
*MOT: shes probably heard us talking about pizza night or whatever because she has a brother that loves pizza .
*MOT: and .
*MOT: uh that goes to Mommys .
*MOT: you have all these toys and you want the microphone .
*MOT: um Imean shes not really eating a lot of things yet but shes probably heard us talking t about them and then Im saying them as were playing like spaghetti and icecream .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: um what about is she starting to use like um forks and spoons ?
*MOT: no shes eating with her fingers shes eating finger foods a lot .
*MOT: she eats like cheerios and fruit puffs and stuff like that .
*MOT: but shes familiar shes watched this show on tv with her siblings .
*MOT: the word word WordWorld I think its called .
*MOT: so this is probably looks a little familiar with her .
*EXP: does she know that the animal names ?
*EXP: some of them or would they be familiar with to her ?
*MOT: zebra ?
*MOT: maybe .
*MOT: Imean Im sure shes heard it before on the shows .
*EXP: any of the other animals she might be familiar with ?
*MOT: she well we talk we have a book where xxx we name all the animals in the book that we read at home .
*MOT: so shes probably heard dog before .
*MOT: thats why I grabbed these two .
*MOT: mostly because of their color but shes shes seen those before .
*MOT: um shes familiar with WinniethePooh .
*MOT: and she knows about HelloKitty .
*MOT: because her entire bedroom is decorated that way .
*MOT: shes never seen it in yellow though .
*MOT: she might not totally know that thats HelloKitty yet .
*MOT: uhoh .
*MOT: uhoh Sweetiepie .
*EXP: and then I heard you were playing with the food kind of like imaginary play .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: um is that something that you do at home ?
*MOT: I do that with everything .
*MOT: with her at home .
*MOT: um and everything I typically if I have her on my hip when were walking around the house and doing different things Im naming everything Im picking up .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so she starts to get familiar with spoon .
*MOT: when I was holding the spoon I kept saying it .
*MOT: and the daughter thats two actually was talking at twelve months very very fluently .
*MOT: like you could understand everything and she was really clear .
*MOT: and its probably because I did that with her .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: shes kinda saying some things already .
*MOT: this one .
*EXP: thats exciting .
*MOT: so shell probably be that way as well .
*MOT: Kennipoo I cant have you put it in your mouth and go fer far back in your mouth because youre gonna choke Sweetpea .
*EXP: how did you decide um what to make to use for the imaginary play like the objects ?
*MOT: I was watching her .
*MOT: youknow just seeing what she kept gravica gravitating to .
*MOT: she wanted the food .
*MOT: I kept introducing the books and shes like not right now .
*MOT: and I tried to bring a t stuffed toy and she would like not really pay much attention to it .
*MOT: now shes a little more open I think .
*MOT: shes u shes bored with the food I think .
*MOT: so now shes looking at the other stuff .
*MOT: but I was following her lead .
*EXP: which food items were her favorite ?
*MOT: I think the pizza .
*MOT: um she picked up the spaghetti a little bit .
*MOT: and then the icecream cone .
*MOT: and she gnawed on it .
*MOT: I hope these are clean .
*EXP: yeah we actually clean them um after every visit .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: and she liked the cookie .
*MOT: because it probably because of the colors .
*MOT: and it was easy to pick it up .
*EXP: were you um bringing in other names for what they could be ?
*EXP: certain things ?
*EXP: just kind of like .
*MOT: uhuh .
*MOT: I called them what they are .
*EXP: yeah okay .
*MOT: yep .
*MOT: I want her to learn it the right way .
*MOT: I told her that these were both spaghetti even though Im not sure if they are .
*MOT: one looks totally different than the other one but .
*MOT: Kennedy honey thats you keep going after and you cant have that .
*MOT: thats gonna get jabbed in your throat .
*EXP: how about the books ?
*MOT: which ones did you .
*MOT: I was trying to show her this yellow one because she likes yellow she tends to gravitate to the color yellow s because its nice and bright and cheerful I think .
*MOT: and she touched the little fur for a second .
*MOT: but shes her attention span when reading is not quite there .
*MOT: so we can get through a couple of pages but she really just wants to eat it .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and and play with the pages .
*MOT: so thats usually what I let her do with books .
*MOT: but I read every night to the other ones and shes usually sitting right there .
*MOT: sometimes shes really attentive to it .
*MOT: shes actually listening .
*MOT: at least it looks like it .
*EXP: do you have any of the same books at home ?
*MOT: um I have a lot of DoctorSeuss books I dont have that one though .
*MOT: I think I TheFootBook looks familiar .
*MOT: and I have a book very similar to this one OntheFarm .
*MOT: its not quite this one but its very similar to this .
*MOT: and its got the thick pages like that .
*MOT: this is the first time Ive seen the peekaboo book thats cute .
*MOT: but she would rip this one .
*MOT: because its not really thick .
*MOT: but .
*EXP: how did she do with it today ?
*MOT: she did fine I got through it but she kept trying to youknow eat the pages .
*EXP: was there a page that she maybe you thought or she did think was particularly exciting ?
*MOT: she liked this curtain page .
*MOT: and maybe because it split in two and she could grab it easier .
*MOT: this one .
*MOT: she didnt really care what was under it she was more or less con interested .
*MOT: uhoh Im sorry honey .
*MOT: she was more or less concerned about the actual .
