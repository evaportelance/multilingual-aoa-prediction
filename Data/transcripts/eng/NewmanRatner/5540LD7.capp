*MOT: but then once she had the spoons thats about it .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: uh she really didnt youknow if I if I showed her something shed be distracted for a second .
*MOT: but she really I guess likes these the noise they make or something .
*MOT: I guess she likes things that make noise .
*EXP: does she play with anything else that makes noise ?
*MOT: uh she had the keys for a little bit and was shaking them .
*MOT: but um when she discovered the spoon she seemed to like them best of all .
*EXP: and you think its just because of the noise probably ?
*MOT: well she she seemed to have liked to grab the big one .
*MOT: I think it was easy to hold she would and she would just shake it around .
*MOT: I think she liked shaking it around .
*MOT: she she would drop them and she would youknow shed have the big one and then shed switch to having all the little ones .
*MOT: and then switch back to having the big one .
*MOT: it was interesting .
*MOT: we dont play with measuring spoons at home maybe well hafta get you some huh ?
*EXP: yeah I was gonna ask you if she played with anything similar to these ?
*MOT: well we have measuring spoons when she cooks with when we cook in the kitchen .
*MOT: well give her like a spoon or a cup we dont give her youknow all of them together so no .
*EXP: do you think she would recognize something like that do the single ones you give her are they anything like these ?
*EXP: are you talking about just like a regular spoon ?
*MOT: no we give her measure she had a measuring spoon and a measuring cup the other day .
*MOT: so she might recognize them .
*MOT: I mean theyre white .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: theyre similar shape .
*MOT: but weve never given her like a group of them connected .
*MOT: they could also be similar to like youknow keys that she tries to take from us that I dont let her have .
*MOT: like car keys and stuff .
*EXP: okay so shes seen keys .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but she didnt want these she wanted these .
*EXP: thats interesting xxx .
*MOT: you like those .
*EXP: did she um play with any of the other food or .
*MOT: she she picked up a plate she pi she was rolling this around for a little bit .
*MOT: trying to um .
*MOT: and she picked up this as well for a little bit .
*MOT: and the cheese for a little bit .
*MOT: bef um shes and then just a second ago she had the slice of pizza .
*MOT: shes just I noticed she likes um she tends to like to pick up flatt flatter things .
*MOT: I think theyre easier for her to hold .
*MOT: when she tried to pick this up she had more of a problem with it .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*EXP: did she uh show any interest in any of the books ?
*MOT: um I tried to show her a book and she pushed it away .
*MOT: she was like I wanna play with the keys .
*MOT: stop distracting me .
*EXP: no books this time .
*MOT: no book this time .
*EXP: how about any of those stuffed animals ?
*MOT: no I tried to attract her attention with the frog .
*MOT: and the dog and even the puppet .
*MOT: moving it around and having it talk to her kiss her and she would look at it but then she went straight back to the key the the um measuring spoons .
*EXP: and how about the baby doll ?
*MOT: she smiled at it and l um but she didnt really um she wanted to play with the spoons .
*EXP: but she looked at it .
*MOT: she did she looked at it she smiled at it .
*MOT: she even made like a little noise but then she went back to spoons .
*EXP: so out of all these things obviously the measuring spoons were the favorite what about the n if those werent there what would you say would guess would be the most interesting for her based on her personality or what you see at home ?
*MOT: um anything that can she make make noise .
*MOT: she likes to shake things like rattles and and things like that .
*MOT: but if it wasnt the measuring spoons she probably would have played with the keys more .
*MOT: if both of those were gone I would imagine she would have well when I first set her down in the middle she went straight for the pile of of food .
*MOT: probably would have just spent her time picking those up and banging them together and and um picking up different ones passing them back and forth between her hands .
*EXP: does she bang other things together at home ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: we dont have blocks here sometimes moms will stack these does she have any blocks at home ?
*MOT: no she doesnt not yet .
*EXP: yeah thats hard to pick up .
*MOT: yeah she just cant seem to get that very well yet .
*EXP: xxx does she like books at home at any particular time ?
*MOT: we read stories before her nap and bedtime so youknow after playtimes done .
*MOT: I dont have the books out I guess at the same time as her toys .
*EXP: and then does she have any favorites that you look at at home ?
*MOT: she likes the the ones that she can touch .
*MOT: thats I bought this out at first but she wasnt interested .
*MOT: she likes to be able to um touch the feely books while we read them .
*EXP: okay lets see what would you say interested her the very least ?
*MOT: um today ?
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: the books .
*MOT: she wasnt interested in having me read to her she wanted to play .
*EXP: okay and at home do you think she prefers books or toys ?
*MOT: um probably toys .
*MOT: um I mean she we have like a set story time .
*MOT: story times during the day before each of her naps and at bedtime well read to her three books .
*MOT: but shes kinda settled down .
*MOT: but she smiles like when I youknow get her changed and everything in her jammies and well get the books shell smile at them .
*MOT: so she likes to hear the stories she likes to likes to look at the pictures .
*MOT: um I guess its part of the routine .
*EXP: right right and she enjoys that .
*EXP: okay does she have any dolls at home ?
*MOT: she has one doll we just got it for her like two days ago a baby a little squishy baby doll .
*EXP: okay and how about any stuffed animals at home ?
*MOT: we do have some but she really doesnt play with them a lot because she mostly wants to chew on them and they get all gross .
*EXP: right thats understandable .
*EXP: xxx without an older sibling I find that most of the time infants her age dont have play food .
*MOT: we dont have play food at home .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: not yet .
*MOT: not yet .
*EXP: not yet I think that might be all the questions .
*EXP: and I guess do you think there are any of the items here that you think that she would recognize the names of at this point ?
*MOT: um maybe baby .
*MOT: um maybe book .
*MOT: thats probably maybe keys thats probably about it .
