*EXP: um so ah tell me about how you guys played today and what you played with .
*MOT: uh mostly with real things .
*MOT: well toy real things .
*MOT: the spoon .
*MOT: um one of the first things she picked up was a sippy cup .
*MOT: which is what she drinks with most of the time xxx the time just a regular cup .
*MOT: um and then shes learning to feed herself so the spoon is what she played with the most .
*MOT: and then plates .
*MOT: and it seemed like everything that was food related she did .
*MOT: xxx try to use the spoon to pick it up or she asked me to open a bottle .
*MOT: that was most of the stuff .
*MOT: I engaged with the book but she wasnt that interested today she had too many other competing toys .
*MOT: that was it mostly and then I initiated I think I initiated the thing with the doll .
*MOT: Im xxx oh no she found the babys shoe was off .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: so she tried to put the shoe on her foot I think .
*MOT: out ya mouth .
*MOT: uh yeah .
*EXP: um what about the does she read books at or do you read books to her at home ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but usually um its just a book and no other toys so we usually can go through .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: the entire book .
*MOT: but we hadta stop a couple a times .
*MOT: and usually shell wanna read the book again after we read it .
*MOT: but its not thats not happening today .
*EXP: uh what made you think that the books that you picked up she would like ?
*MOT: um these books um at first I thought the words would be big but when I opened it I saw it was really small .
*MOT: she got disengaged really quick .
*MOT: but usually the ones with like big words shell usually follow along with those .
*MOT: but this one um she has one similar to it and it has the flip .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: parts to it .
*MOT: and so shes a little bit more engaged in these than the ones with the really small words .
*EXP: do you play um that game with her ?
*MOT: the book yeah .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: its its a slightly different one .
*MOT: um its by Karen Cassiswell .
*MOT: oh um one with potty training .
*MOT: and one is called um WheresBabysBellyButton .
*MOT: but you read one part and then they flip it open and see the answer or whatever .
*MOT: mhm but yeah we do that one too .
*EXP: she enjoys that ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: do you still play um do you still play like peekaboo with her at home like without a book ?
*MOT: not as much anymore .
*MOT: we use to all the time .
*MOT: but and really if you say that p word shell do it .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: so you hafta react .
*MOT: like shell close her eyes for you to say oh there you are .
*MOT: oh okay I thought I triggered the game .
*EXP: is she pretty incessant about it when she xxx ?
*MOT: yeah she likes it a lot .
*MOT: she likes it a lot .
*EXP: was she saying it with that ?
*EXP: with that book ?
*MOT: no because no .
*MOT: she just likes the reaction when she hides her face and shows it .
*MOT: she likes for you to act surprised like oh my gosh I was looking for you there you are .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: and do you think she likes the rhyming in either of the books ?
*MOT: I dont even know if she notices the rhyming .
*MOT: I dont I think I go so slow or sporadically that you dont even realize I Ive rhymed .
*MOT: usually Im describing things in the book so I never end up rhyming .
*MOT: usually I dont .
*MOT: like usually if I were were to go through the book um I would read this side and then Id ask you know what is this and then by the time we open it where are her eyes wheres her mouth wheres her nose etcetera .
*MOT: so I dont even know if she notices that .
*MOT: the book is rhyming .
*MOT: cause of all the extras Im throwing in .
*EXP: so you ask her like a lot of questions when youre playing ?
*MOT: yeah about the picture .
*MOT: and then we also have the um YourBabyCanRead .
*MOT: so usually I show her the word .
*MOT: she only knows how read a few words but .
*MOT: um and then we open it .
*MOT: and then I ask her something about that question .
*MOT: and that doesnt rhyme at all .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: right ?
*CHI: hm .
*EXP: do you have other doctor Seuss books at home ?
*MOT: actually really I can not really I dont think we have any doctor Seuss books .
*MOT: for her yet .
*MOT: um yeah .
*MOT: no doctor Seuss books .
*MOT: Im surprised now that you say that .
*EXP: thats the first one she got to read .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: um have you does she know her you were saying that you ask her questions like wheres um the facial features but does she know her other body parts ?
*MOT: mhm .

*EXP: shy baby .
*EXP: shes a shy baby .
*EXP: youre just .
*MOT: just smiling huh ?
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: um so about does she play with dolls at home ?
*MOT: not really .
*MOT: and its actually because of this study that I actually got one .
*MOT: and she hardly plays with it .
*MOT: we I dunno .
*MOT: I guess we never thought to get one and I guess maybe by the time we thought to get one she wasnt interested or maybe shell be interested later but not really .
*MOT: ooh gotta change your diaper honeybun .
*EXP: how did you play with the doll today ?
*EXP: how did you guys interact with it ?
*MOT: um kinda how when we did play with the one at home wheres her eyes nose or something like that .
*MOT: except the only thing different was that um she wanted to try to put the dolls shoe on .
*MOT: where as at home nothing comes off .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: the doll so theres no you know parts she can put in her mouth .
*EXP: thats cool .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: uh and then what about the food what were what were how did you guys play with the food um .
*EXP: and like what foods did you find she was enjoying more were xxx .
*MOT: the sippy cup and the bottle so the juice .
*MOT: the spoons for sure .
*MOT: like most of the dishes .
*MOT: um she had the applesauce but Im not certain she knows what this is .
*MOT: I saw her pick up the pizza and try to eat it but we dont really eat pizza at home .
*MOT: uh I had the peas and spaghetti but I picked those up .
*MOT: um but it seems like shes mostly playing with things that she recognize .
*MOT: the juice spoon plate .
*MOT: mostly .
*MOT: okay now that I said that of course she picks up the ice cream .
*EXP: youre funny .
*EXP: did you play at all with any of the stuffed animals or any of the animals ?
*MOT: uhuh .
*MOT: she didnt pick any of them up .
*MOT: and I didnt initiate it either .
*EXP: can you think of anything else that you may have like even if you you played with the food but you also um like elaborated and played with them in different ways than the traditional .
*MOT: hm .
*MOT: uhuh .
*MOT: um oh well there were three plates so um I just incorporated kinda incorporated numbers like one plate two plate three plate .
*MOT: um we havent really taught her numbers .
*MOT: I havent actually tried too much but .
*MOT: just as it randomly comes about .
*MOT: well well throw numbers into something .
*MOT: but not as intentional as it is that we try to um teach her words or you know use a book or something .
*MOT: but thats the only other other thing that I think I did .
*MOT: oh or the um feed the baby the bottle .
*MOT: out ya mouth .
*MOT: feed the baby the bottle .
*MOT: I think I didnt mention that .
*EXP: are there different ways that she knows that like um what shes doing when youre playing you know what shes doing like you approve of like yeah lets play this way lets change the way were playing those different ways xxx .
*MOT: um yeah like maybe with her putting .
*MOT: xxx I think she kinda knows theyre toys but she kinda knows theyre food so she keeps putting it in her mouth so .
*MOT: thats the easy part I could say out your mouth and shell know .
*MOT: um but usually if shes doing something the right way or well then Ill try to encourage her .
*MOT: and if shes not then you know then she can just play .
*MOT: opposed um I hardly hafta tell her no or dont do that um with playing .
*MOT: and when she puts something in her mouth I can specifically say out ya mouth and she knows .
*MOT: um what were doing but .
*MOT: thats it usually shes doing something well I encourage it .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: uhoh .
*EXP: and how about like scripts like you know when youre playing you kind of like role play you kinda get like into the do find that you do that here here or in at home as well ?
*MOT: um lets see .
*EXP: you kinda get into the pretend role so you like add not dialogue but like answer pretend pretend play you know ?
*MOT: um maybe she has a pretend kitchen at home so sometimes I pretend like were cooking .
*MOT: so um we might I dunno I need think .
*MOT: I guess I wouldnt really qualify .
*MOT: cause we pretend like were cooking food and washing dishes and putting things in the fridge .
*MOT: so you know Ill tell h her where are the eggs we xxx put in the refrigerator before they go bad .
*MOT: and shell look for the eggs and then she knows and the egg is a circle so .
*MOT: she hasta put the egg in a circular opening to put it in the refrigerator .
*MOT: um that might be the closest to a script um .
*MOT: yeah theres a play laptop that we have at but my husband plays more with her than I do what else do we have ?
*MOT: yeah as far as something coming close to a script maybe the play kitchen .
*MOT: cause there certain you know theres certain things you hafta do so .
*MOT: you end up saying the same thing .
*MOT: I think theres only so much you can say about a refrigerator and an egg so .
*MOT: I guess thats the closest we hafta a script .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: okay cause xxx you know today youre playing with like the plates and youre feeding each other so I thought maybe some xxx .
*MOT: oh .
*MOT: oh I see well yeah um .
*MOT: and this is actually this is very recent where shell usually have her sippy cup .
*MOT: and shell pretend to feed me and Ill pretend like Im drinking then Ill say thank you .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: and then if I do the same thing shes sposta say thank you if I pretend you know feed her something .
*MOT: um yeah .
*MOT: I think the yeah .
*MOT: that and thats very recent like within the last couple of weeks where shell pretend to feed us or you know food or something like that .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and so shell feed us and shell expect us to say thank you .
*MOT: and then we do the same thing in reverse .
*MOT: mhm out ya mouth .
*MOT: out ya mouth .
*EXP: so um .
*EXP: I forgot what I was gonna ask Im sorry .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: uh so these scripts that you were saying these scripts were new .
*MOT: out ya mouth .
*EXP: um and then you do oh I was gonna say so um when you ask her to say things does she repeat them back usually ?
*MOT: usually .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and then thats how I figure out what words you know she can say cause otherwise sometimes I think it just wont even come up .
*MOT: and then we wont even know .
*MOT: so and Ill even pick random things like microphone .
*MOT: I think I tried to see if if she could try to say microphone .
*MOT: her mouth opened but it wasnt happening .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: come back .
*EXP: is she um are you teaching her to potty train or just like xxx .
*MOT: were about yeah kinda sorta .
*MOT: I first hafta figure out how to potty train and then well teach her how .
*MOT: um but I think Ive stepped off cause usually shell tell me when she hasta use the bathroom or something beforehand but then I realize she was doing it and I you know she didnt say it .
*MOT: I didnt wanna put it too much on the video .
*MOT: are you boobooing ?
*MOT: but otherwise I wouldnt I would normally emphasize like while shes doing it .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so that shell you know start to tell me when she hasta .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and then maybe I can throw her on the potty beforehand .
*MOT: Im not sure how Im sposta do it Ill figure it out sooner or later .
*MOT: shes only a year and a half so .
*EXP: exactly .
*MOT: from what I hear I have time .
*EXP: exactly .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but um for a while she was really good at letting us know when she hadta do it just before she would do it .
*EXP: wow .
*MOT: yeah but I I guess I didnt stay on top of it because now sometimes its only sometimes that it happens .
*EXP: well you know when things are new theyre so excited to like tell you about it you know what I mean ?
*MOT: thats probably what it is yeah .
*MOT: thats probably what it is .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um can you tell me any differences that you noticed on how you played or what you played with from the last time when she was a lot younger ?
*MOT: um last time I think I remember her playing with things that were brightly colored .
*MOT: if I remember right .
*MOT: it was like she would play with yellow stuff or orange stuff something really based on color moreso .
*MOT: and then today it seems like she plays with things that she recognized .
*MOT: the shoes the plates the spoons the juice the juice in the bottle etcetera .
*MOT: xxx she hardly played with any of the stuffed animals but she doesnt really play with the stuffed animals at home either .
*MOT: um what else do I remember about last time .
*MOT: I think she played a little bit more with the doll last xxx one of these visits .
*MOT: but today definitely uh I dont think she played with dishes at all last time .
*MOT: at all right ?
*MOT: so today it seemed more like things she recognized and definitely towards what shes learning which is how to feed herself .
*MOT: it seems to be what shes playing with now .
*EXP: thats interesting .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: alright well I think thats all the questions I have unless you wanna add any other um differences or anything that was interesting that you saw in playing today .
*MOT: um not much usually if Im playing with her we only have a few toys .
*MOT: thats the only thing different .
*MOT: when shes allowed to play with herself she can just go for it .
*MOT: its only different it doesnt open its a toy .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: that was her saying help .
*EXP: aw .
*MOT: ooh gotta change your diaper honeybun .
*EXP: alright xxx .
*MOT: stink .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: alright well lets get you outta here then .
*EXP: thank you for coming .

*EXP: oh youre welcome .
