*EXP: I know that was really funny .
*MOT: so he really Imean he definitely .
*MOT: enjoys that part .
*MOT: hes always been fascinated in the kitchen .
*EXP: do you think he um wouldve recognized some of these foods ?
*MOT: Imean it sounded like he recognized some of them .
*MOT: he did yeah like he the cupcakes he picked up immediately and said cakes cakes .
*MOT: and the icecream he recognized definitely .
*MOT: there was only once piece of pizza but I know in the past hes picked up the pizza and said pizza .
*MOT: he loves pizza .
*MOT: I was surprised because he loves hotdogs .
*MOT: and he picked up the hotdog and called it a banana and I was like .
*MOT: I think it was just another case of youknow it doesnt look like the real thing and so .
*MOT: and he doesnt eat them on buns either so .
*EXP: mm .
*MOT: that might have been it too it was on a bun .
*EXP: true yeah .
*MOT: but um yeah he definitely recognized and he youknow and and .
*MOT: big round fruit that he doesnt know what it is is an apple because .
*MOT: its all apples .
*MOT: because we love apples .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: alot of kids make that mistake theyre like oh yeah apple ah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: well I dont know honestly like weve had peaches but its usually been like the fruit cup of peaches youknow like I dont know that weve had a fresh peach .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: since last summer and so .
*MOT: he has no memory of peaches .
*EXP: exactly .
*MOT: although he was eating nectarines like crazy the other day apparently when they went to the farmers market with the daycare .
*MOT: but .
*EXP: and then how about these animals did he seem to be interested in these ?
*MOT: he didnt look at them at all although he does xxx he does like animals Imean when we go to the zoo or read a book or .
*MOT: um at daycare theyve got dinosaurs theyre the same kind of material but youknow like the big dinosaurs .
*MOT: he totally gets into them .
*MOT: but this was more interesting to him today and so .
*MOT: and he will hell sit and play with the same thing for a long time like way longer than I would expect a two year old to .
*MOT: but um and I think some of these animals are not as familiar to him like if it was more Imean theres some in there like some of the farm animals he would recognize but if it was like .
*MOT: he doesnt play with stuff that he doesnt recognize especially when its in a big jumble .
*MOT: like all we he has a pile of toys at home that um .
*MOT: youknow down are downstairs pile of toys its just a mess and he doesnt play with them because theyre kindof like in a big pile like in a big mess together .
*MOT: he will play with his bucket of tools because theyre all in a bucket and like youknow thats his tools .
*MOT: and hell play like if theres something he can easily pull out like hell do it but if its a mess like he wont play with it because its like its almost like I dont know if its too overwhelming to him or if hes .
*MOT: he doesnt wanna dig through it or whatever but he doesnt typically play with stuff unless its like .
*MOT: sorted I guess is the best way to put it .
*EXP: well I remember you said like he wouldnt have liked to leave the crayons like a mess so .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: so he kinda just likes organization which is youknow this is all kindof just thrown on the floor so maybe .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: and especially when its not something hes really excited about like Imean hes looking at the food and hes like oh Im excited about this and I can play with this because its something he recognizes .
*MOT: but like these animals he didnt recognize alot of them and they were all kindof mixed together and so I think it was just like too much to deal with .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and the dolls too and he just has never had an interest really in dolls or stuffed animals or anything like that .
*MOT: Imean once in awhile hell pick up a doll and youknow hold it like a baby or something like that but .
*MOT: Imean never with stuffed animals .
*MOT: oh thankyou .
*EXP: so he doesnt try to like feed like feed stuffed animals or anything like that he might like carry it around but .
*MOT: so Imean once in like once in a while hell .
*CHI: mom .
*CHI: xxx mommy have some .
*MOT: um okay sorry .
*MOT: um but like Imean if hell do that once in awhile but its very very rare .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: hes more into like doing things and being like handson .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: heck yeah .
*MOT: yep .
*MOT: he also play still its so funny like even like infant toys that we were about to put away .
*MOT: um he plays with them in a different way .
*EXP: hm .
*MOT: now Im trying to think of what he was just doing the other day .
*MOT: but he it was a toy that we were like ready to put away and he did something with it and Im like I so wouldnt have expected that .
*MOT: um but hell he still pulls youknow like the youknow the stacking rings or whatever and like hell do stuff with that kindof stuff and those pop beads I dont know if youve ever seen them but theyre basically these big plastic beads and they pop together .
*MOT: they have like a hole in one and and then like something sticking out of the other and he still loves playing with those so Imean sometimes its just simple stuff like that .
*EXP: oh .
*EXP: well if you said hes really imaginative like he probably just makes something up youknow for what it is and just kinda goes with it .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: what on earth Im trying to think of what that was the other day because were literally like going through his toys like getting ready to put stuff away and then he started playing with something that he hadnt played with in ages .
*MOT: but completely differently than hed played with it before .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so you just never know .
*EXP: so in the past play sessions did he tend to gravitate towards the food or .
*CHI: mama have some .
*MOT: oh thankyou .
*MOT: yeah it was definitely the kitchen stuff because I think Im trying to remember it was books .
*MOT: food .
*MOT: oh thankyou .
*MOT: thankyou .
*MOT: and um stuffed animals .
*MOT: and the stuffed animals he had zero interest in we read a couple books here and there .
*MOT: can you go play with Devon please ?

*MOT: yeah okay .
*EXP: do you guys do alot of reading at home ?
*MOT: ohmygosh he loves to read .
*MOT: Imean like this morning I hadta like cut him off because we hadta get ready to leave .
*MOT: but he we my sister gave us this um its a SesameStreet alphabet collection .
*MOT: and so theres one book for every letter and then theres like four other books that have like sections of the alphabet so like a through f .
*MOT: and then um .
*MOT: so but anyway so each one has a different story some of them are rhymy some are just stories some are just youknow theyre all very different but theyve all got SesameStreet characters which he recognizes .
*MOT: we dont watch SesameStreet frequently he does a daycare once in awhile but like he always recognizes all the characters .
*MOT: and hes starting to recognize the letters Imean he just like everythings green everythings g lately .
*MOT: um but like Ill tell him Ill say this is s and hell say s and then well read the book and um .
*MOT: youknow and theres like the k book it says which one of these things starts with k and he very frequently picks out which thing starts with k and he wants to read them all the time .
*MOT: and theyre board books so youknow theyre really easy for him to turn the pages and everything .
*MOT: Imean there was one time we sat and read twenty books in one sitting .
*MOT: like I just sat on the floor he sat in my lap and he would go and get another one and we would read it and then he would go and get another one we Imean it was amazing and like its not unlikely for us to read five books at a time .
*EXP: he has a really long attention span then .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and its funny because like Ill pull out how about we read this today and he like doesnt have interest in reading other books as often .
*MOT: um theres other ones that he does like to read but theyre the little Golden books theres been a couple of those like theres a train one .
*MOT: a fire engine one and a truck one .
*MOT: that he really gets into like all the vehicles he really gets into .
*MOT: um he loves theres a book about planes that we have and he likes that .
*MOT: um but otherwise like he just youknow he really gets into the board books theres a prayer b a book of prayers like your first prayers book of prayers or something that he has gotten into lately I dont know why because its not a story its just like page after page of like these short little like three or four line prayers and Im like okay .
*EXP: will he sit by himself and try to read or hell kinda .
*MOT: when were home not usually but like he wanted to there was a book he wanted to read this morning we read two .
*MOT: and I said why dont you bring that one downstairs with us while we get ready and you can look at it and he had it and then he brought it in the car and he will hell sit in the car and hell look through it own his own .
