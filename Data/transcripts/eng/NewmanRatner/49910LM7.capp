*MOT: things that make noise .
*MOT: things that move .
*MOT: things that she can definitely explore with her mouth and her hands .
*EXP: have there been any changes since the last visit in terms of toys or games ?
*MOT: um she loves these books like the peekaboo books .
*MOT: anything that she can lift up and see .
*MOT: like she loves those .
*MOT: as you can tell like most stuff goes into her mouth so .
*MOT: she likes these books more than like just the regular ones .
*MOT: but the ones that youknow she still likes them .
*MOT: and she likes to turn the pages .
*MOT: but these guys are like a new favorite .
*MOT: so like before naptime we usually read some kind of book like this .
*MOT: so she really really likes those .
*MOT: and like the stuffed animals youknow she kinda and dolls theres not a whole lot of interest in .
*MOT: she takes them leaves them youknow .
*MOT: not as interested in those .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: so which of the toys seemed to interest her the least .

*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: lets see .
*EXP: do you remember what she played with at the last visit ?
*MOT: she loved this thing .
*MOT: she liked the bee .
*MOT: and she played with a lot of like the food these things .
*MOT: because I think at that point she was really kind of teething .
*MOT: and she might still she might be getting ready for some more teeth .
*MOT: so she played with the harder things a lot .
*MOT: and she played with some of the books .
*MOT: but again like this was the only kind of thing that interested her of all those .
*MOT: this yeah this stuff .
*EXP: interesting stuff on top ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: which books did she prefer to read or look at with you beside the ones that .
*MOT: I think the ones that have like either like the like the kinda like the touch and feel or the peekaboo ones versus the plain ones .
*MOT: because Imean shell Imean she still is interested but not as interested in them .
*EXP: does she play with similar toys at home ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: Imean the these type of books .
*MOT: she has lots of kind of blocks at home that she loves playing with .

*MOT: oh there you go Lilly .
*MOT: you got it .
*MOT: you got it .
*EXP: so does she prefer books or toys in general ?
*MOT: um it depends .
*MOT: Imean I think theres a time like if she if she can see the books then shell wanna go after them .
*MOT: like if theyre out .
*MOT: but if shes just around her toys then shes kind of happy .
*MOT: and if theres like both of them together .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: I think like when she gets a little more kind of like tired like around naptime because of her routine then she kind of moves more toward books .
*MOT: because she knows youknow .
*MOT: but if shes awake like this and pretty active then she probably wants to play with toys yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: do you think she .
*EXP: well she didnt really play with the food that much .
*EXP: do you think she recognizes any of them ?
*MOT: she might recognize the peas .
*MOT: because she eats a lot of like .
*MOT: I think she was trying to like pull them apart .
*MOT: because she can youknow now now she can pick up like whole peas and actually eat them now .
*MOT: versus like the pureed stuff .
*MOT: but no .
*MOT: like the bread and the waffle I dont think she probably just thinks like a block .
*MOT: you know .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: are you trying to eat that ?
*EXP: do you think there are any items that arent here that she could recognize the names of ?
*EXP: or any items that are here ?
