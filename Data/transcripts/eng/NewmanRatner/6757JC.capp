*EXP: thats okay .
*MOT: that we really wants like paper and the remote control .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: so which toys do you think he was most interested in ?
*MOT: um toys that make sounds .
*MOT: and toys that he could put in his mouth .
*EXP: okay why do you think that he likes those ?
*MOT: um because hes pretty active and he likes to clang things around .
*MOT: so shake his arm and throw things .
*MOT: so thats just been my observation thats what he gravitates to normally .
*MOT: an that and things that he isnt allowed to have .
*EXP: okay which ones do you think he was least interested in ?
*MOT: um he wasnt really interested in what I was doing with the food .
*MOT: um xxx the baby .

*MOT: yeah um we have that one at home .
*MOT: we havent looked at it in a few months though .
*MOT: I think I dont actually know where it is right now .
*EXP: do you think in general he prefers books or toys ?
*MOT: I think it depends .
*MOT: he likes to play with the books .
*MOT: like when we try to we try to read him um books every night as part of our going to bed routine .
*MOT: and he always is trying to grab them and play with them instead of reading for the most part .
*MOT: um so I guess it just .
*MOT: he kind of alternates between playing with the toys .
*MOT: like if we were at home and he had the option he would kind of take one and then the other .
*MOT: its not like I think he exclusively prefers one or the other .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: um do you have a babydoll at home or ?
*MOT: um no not we have more stuffed animals .
*MOT: um we dont have a babydoll like that .
*MOT: yeah so thats kind of the first time I think hes seen a doll like that .
*EXP: um and do you think he would recognize the names of any of these items ?
*MOT: um books .
*MOT: book definitely .
*MOT: um I dont know .
*MOT: probably not anything else actually .
*MOT: uh sippycup maybe .
*MOT: weve just started using that .
*MOT: um recently .
*MOT: so maybe book and sippycup .
*EXP: and any of the animals ?
*MOT: um maybe bumblebee .
*MOT: maybe WinniethePooh .
*MOT: maybe the rooster .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um do you have similar toys at home or do you have ?
*MOT: um we dont really have uh I dont the stuffed animals that we have he doesnt play like I dont um generally give to him to play with .
*MOT: um we dont have any of the food .
*MOT: we have little rattles and things .
*MOT: um we have the books .
*MOT: thats about it .
*EXP: are there other toys at home that he likes to play with that we dont have here ?
*MOT: um yeah he likes um he likes um things that have um crinkly cellophane in them .
*MOT: he has some like teething toys that are like stuffed with plastic parts and things .
*MOT: and he has little trucks that he like FisherPrice dump truck kinda thing that he likes .
*MOT: and theres a toy called a Whoozit .
*MOT: which has like um its black and white on one side and the other side has a little face on it .
*MOT: youre just into it arent you ?
*EXP: is there anything else you think we should know about his play skills things we didnt see here or is this typical of how he plays ?
*MOT: um yeah it typi like he likes to he likes shaking things that make noise he likes .
*MOT: doing that when hes really excited .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: is there anything else that you think we should know ?
*MOT: I dont think so .
*EXP: alright .
*EXP: well were all done then .
*EXP: excuse me do you think its okay if I ask you some questions ?
*MOT: yeah sure .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um so what do you what did you play with today ?
*MOT: we played with I was he was really interested in the baby at first .
*MOT: so we were playing the baby .
*MOT: and then the bottle and the sippycup were a big hit .
*MOT: and then um the icecream cones and the pizza slices .
*MOT: the food related items .
*MOT: and then the bee a little bit and the clock .
*EXP: what did you think um why do you think he enjoyed playing with the food ?
*MOT: um we dont have anything like that at home .
*MOT: um and honestly I think .
*MOT: well the bottle and the sippycup we have at home .
*MOT: and I think he likes to play with those .
*MOT: um but the the like fake food stuff we dont have it anything like this at home and I think the shapes felt good on his gums .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: everyth because hes teething so everything goes in his mouth .
*MOT: um so he was just into exploring the different textures of them .
*EXP: you think he recognized any of the names of the food ?
*MOT: um maybe the icecream cone but probably not anything else because hes um we are slow at introducing solids .
*MOT: um I wrote in my little um form weve were investigat investigating he might have a food allergy like with dairy .
*MOT: so hes hes only on purees and I havent made a huge deal about food just yet so .
*MOT: um he probably didnt recognize anything .
*MOT: he has a book with like a picture book and it has icecream cone in it so he might recognize that from the picture book .
*EXP: okay yeah because I noticed you were intro you were showing him a lot of different foods in the pile .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah he um he probably wouldnt know anything youknow he wouldnt recognize them at ho from at home but since we dont have these at home I was showing them to him .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: how about any um any of the stuffed animals or any of the animals ?
*MOT: he doesnt really get into the stuffed animals so much .
*MOT: um I knew he would like the bee because we have this MisterBrownCanMoo book and whenever we get to the bee part with the buzzing he was really into the buzzing so um .
*MOT: but stuffed animals he kinda could care less about .
*MOT: he likes things that make noise .
*MOT: um and he can bang together .
*MOT: um yeah .
*EXP: xxx doing it right ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um have I noticed hes playing that um playing with those two items .
*MOT: the peas .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: yeah I think hes frustrated that he cant like break apart that to put it on the spoon .
*MOT: or maybe he just likes the sound it makes when it runs up against the texture youknow ?
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: I dunno .
*EXP: was he interested in um the measuring spoons as well ?
*MOT: I thought he would be more interested than he actually was .
*MOT: because um he has a friend who has something like this and he loves to take them and play with them .
*MOT: because the sound and I think um probably he likes the shape of it in his mouth probably .
*EXP: is he exploring at home with the same type of things ?
*MOT: yeah we um he will sit for several minutes playing at home with pots and pans and like uh spatulas and whisks .
*MOT: oh be gentle with that honey .
*MOT: um yeah so like kitchen um utensils and things he hes into .
*EXP: um so you said you have some books did you .
*EXP: oh you know what I heard that you were singing rockabye baby ?
*MOT: uhhuh .
*EXP: um is that something you sing ?
*MOT: sometimes um I will just ro like play around and rock him and sing it .
*MOT: so I was seeing if he would notice when I was doing that to the baby he seemed to get a kick out of that .
*MOT: because normally like I rock him like not to go to sleep but just for f to be funny .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um like to play around with him .
*MOT: and he thinks its funny when I do that to him so I was seeing what he would do when I did it to the baby .
*MOT: and it seemed like he was he got the the joke of it I guess .
*EXP: yeah I not you were playing quite a little bit at the beginning with the baby .
*MOT: yeah because we dont have a babydoll like this .
*MOT: it actually it reminds me of like a toy we had when I was little at my grandmothers hou youknow its old school .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um and um Ive been showing him we have like birth announcements on our fridge of other babies .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and Ive been showing him the photo cards like baby baby baby so this was a good .
*MOT: and of course he hes seen babies .
*MOT: but this was a good opportunity to be like heres a babydoll youknow .
*MOT: because we dont have one at home .
*EXP: okay and but hes seen other babies or ?
*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: yeah ?
*MOT: yeah I always try to point out other ba like live babies .
*MOT: where are you going silly ?
*EXP: toys everywhere .
*EXP: um and then some of the things you were doing with the babydoll ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: um can you talk a little bit about that .
*MOT: yeah sure .
*MOT: um I was trying to see if he would um make the connection like the baby and the bottle this is how you youknow bring the bottle over to feed the baby .
*MOT: um I was trying to point out its body parts .
*MOT: um because thats something Im trying to teach him .
*MOT: youknow its hard to tell youknow when hes sposta be able to uh pick that up .
*MOT: but um yeah Imean we have books that are like youknow um that mention the body parts and I always try to reinforce it like these are you ears this is your hair these are your eyes youknow that kind of thing .
*MOT: so I was doing that with the baby .
*MOT: to try and reinforce that you have eyes the baby eyes everybody has eyes that kinda thing .
*MOT: did you want her attention ?
*EXP: hes funny .
*EXP: hes really funny .
*EXP: how about the keys I also noticed that you um .
*MOT: I thought he would like the keys more well he I he has a tendency to know like whats real and whats a toy you know ?
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um because hes really loves my real keys .
*MOT: um so I was trying to get him interested in this but he wasnt really very interested with everything else .
*MOT: um its like he has um fake cellphones and hes more interested in the real cellphone than the fake one so .
*EXP: so he gets it ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: unfortunately .
*EXP: interesting .
*MOT: yeah Imean the minute we offer him a real cellphone hes like yes but .
*MOT: um hang on honey .
*MOT: there we go .
*MOT: thats for grownups okay ?
*MOT: um yeah .
*MOT: he knows the difference between the real ones and the fake ones .
*EXP: alright .
*EXP: okay so I think thats all the questions I have for you today .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: you explained everything that you did .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: um Im just gonna before I shut off the recording Im going to I think just put some the i d on it so I just needta get close to you .
*MOT: okay sure .
*MOT: oh .
*EXP: sorry .
*EXP: today is July twenty seventh two thousand ten .
*EXP: this is participant six seven five seven j c .
*EXP: and this is his visit at um ten months .
*EXP: is it okay if I ask you some questions ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um so uh tell me about what you guys played with .
*MOT: um he was really interested in the food .
*MOT: he was he likes hes still teething so its everything in his mouth chewing on everything .
*MOT: um he doesnt eat um a lot of solids yet still so like he doesnt know like this is pizza thats icecream or anything yet .
*MOT: but um .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but he definitely um is interested in self feeding with a spoon so he was into the spoons and tried to youknow imitate feeding himself and with the bottle and the sippycup .
*MOT: um so yeah he was into those .
*MOT: hes not hes still not really into the stuffed animals because they dont do anything for him .
*MOT: um and then the baby he was into a little bit .
*MOT: and the peekaboo book .
*MOT: whos got you ?
*MOT: yeah see if you can play with that .
*MOT: thats really fun .
*MOT: theyre magnets just like on the fridge .
*MOT: hes like no .
*MOT: um yeah so still I think last time I said oh he likes things that make noise hes still into um anything that makes or he can teethe on .
*MOT: and his new skill seems to be throwing things so he threw a few things .
*MOT: um and I was trying since Imean he doesnt really know like frozen peas or tacos or anything so I was using these as blocks to knock them to build a tower for him to knock down because he likes to do that at home with his we have like um solo cups that we stack up and nest and everything and he likes that .
*MOT: thats the babys face .
*MOT: yeah you gonna get her ?
*MOT: be gentle .
*EXP: were there any foods in particular you were or um I think I noticed he was playing actually with the bottle a lot .
*MOT: yeah he was playing with the bottle .
*MOT: he occasionally takes a bottle at home and a sippycup at home too .
*MOT: so that was kind of um .
*MOT: theres the teething .
*MOT: um so I think he was like oh bottle youknow sippycup .
*MOT: I know those things .
*EXP: what does he usually get in them ?
*MOT: um in the bottle its breast milk and the sippycup is water .
*MOT: so he is not familiar with juice he hasnt had juice .
*MOT: um the reason why hes been slow on solids is because we think he has food allergies so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: thats why hes like not so familiar with all that stuff .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: were there any like food names that maybe you say at home or youre trying to teach him or ?
*MOT: um he probably is familiar with the word ice the words icecream .
*MOT: not because my mother inlaw says um daddy come home bring John an icecream cone kinda like a rhyme .
*MOT: um but he wouldnt associate that well with icecream cone necessarily I dont think .
*MOT: um because dairy is one of the things that we think he has a sensitivity to so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: um apple he may recognize apples because there was apple juice .
*MOT: um he gets apple sauce at home .
*MOT: um but everything else he really we havent really worked on like food words because hes not really getting a lot of food .
*EXP: but the peas .
*MOT: he really I think he really liked their texture .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: youre just cracking yourself up over there .
*MOT: um yeah I think he liked the texture .
*MOT: uh hes had pee puree before but he wouldnt necessarily look at this and say oh thats peas youknow ?
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: because its been a puree .
*EXP: and then um what about the .
*EXP: I can get it .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: the baby .
*EXP: how did you guys play with the baby ?
*MOT: um hes really interested in shoes and socks lately .
*MOT: so I tried to um .
*MOT: and I always point out babies when we seem them .
*MOT: so um I tried to get him interested on the in the shoe and the baby .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: oh is the baby having an icecream cone ?
*MOT: whoops .
*MOT: hi there .
*EXP: so you talk about like body parts and clothing ?
*MOT: yeah um yeah we yeah .
*MOT: we try to Im teach trying to teach him like nose head hair that kinda thing .
*MOT: shoe yeah .
*MOT: you like to show off shoes when you find them .
*MOT: you really like shoes and socks .
*EXP: do you think he knows that word ?
*MOT: I think so .
*MOT: because um hes always going to them at home and showing them to me or pointing to them .
*MOT: and typically when hes doing hes familiar with it .
*MOT: you know what I mean like .
*MOT: oh no .
*MOT: um good boy .
*MOT: wanna come here ?
*MOT: come get the baby .
*MOT: yes .

*MOT: come back here .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: good boy .
*MOT: oh yeah whats that ?

*MOT: and hes he knows okay this is something Ive seen before youknow .
*MOT: its a sock or a shoe .
*MOT: wow .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and then um you said body parts .

*MOT: come on lets go over here .
*MOT: here we go .
*EXP: were there any um any of the books that you played with or ?
*MOT: um yeah we played with the peekaboo book because thats his favorite game Imean hes always .
*MOT: like sometimes hell like if were in my room at home well hell crawl around the bed and kinda like lean .
*MOT: like when whenever he does this motion I know hes like trying to do peekaboo whether its whether somethings in front of him or not .
*MOT: he gets this look on his face .
*MOT: um so thats yeah thats his favorite so I thought he might like that the youknow hide and seek book .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: of course it didnt hold his ten attention for very long when there were things to chew on .
*MOT: but um .
*MOT: yeah I think we have this book at home we havent looked at it too much but .
*MOT: oh maybe not .
*MOT: baby animals is something that we have .
*MOT: um I thought maybe Id show him something that we didnt have at at home .
*EXP: how about the um stuffed animals ?
*EXP: I noticed does he recognize ?
*MOT: he we have a larger version of that be WinniethePooh .
*MOT: um he doesnt play with it .
*MOT: he really isnt very into stuffed animals .
*MOT: uhoh .
*EXP: special surprise .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: special delivery .
*MOT: um hes not really into stuffed animals all that much .
*MOT: so I kept like trying to find something that hed be interested in .
*MOT: like we have a dog at home so hes very familiar with the word dog and puppy and all that .
*MOT: and so there was a little chihuahua here .
*MOT: the chihuahua I was trying to um show him to get him interested in but again its it doesnt youknow do anything interesting and he cant really bite it very well I dont think .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: thats kind of .
*EXP: and I think you played with the waffles too .
*EXP: did you say ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: he doesnt know what they are .
*MOT: but he I think he threw one or somthing I cant remember exactly what he did with it so .
*MOT: hi .

*MOT: yes .
*EXP: and then um you have a nick name for him .
*MOT: yeah Coop .

*MOT: whered your sock go ?
*MOT: thats not the babys .
*MOT: thats not for babies .
*MOT: but youre interested in it .
*MOT: interested in it .

*EXP: it was .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: lets put your sock on .
*MOT: where does your sock go on your feet ?
*EXP: xxx today .
*MOT: um anything he could teeth on .
*MOT: um the sippycup the bottle the spoons .
*MOT: he was kind of interested in the baby and the animals but really and feeding the animals and the baby .
*MOT: no he actually .
*MOT: oh sorry .
*MOT: this is falling apart .
*MOT: um maybe he is hungry I dunno .
*MOT: he hasnt eaten in a few hours .
*EXP: so youve done a play session before right ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: did he play with anything different this time ?
*MOT: um I recall that he was always teething on things so that hasnt changed .
*MOT: um but it was it was um encouraging for me to see him pretending to feed the baby and interacting more with in a pretend way with the stuffed animals and the baby .
*MOT: um because before he kind of wasnt super interested in the animals or the baby so .
*MOT: its nice to see that hes getting into that .
*MOT: Imean at home hes like all about balls and trucks .
*MOT: um and there arent any of those here .
*MOT: so um .
*MOT: yeah there arent any of those here .
*MOT: so uh its nice to see him .
*MOT: we do have a few like stuffed animals that hell rock or youknow do that with but hes he always chooses the trucks and the balls at home even though we have a variety of toys so .
*EXP: did he like any of the animals in particular ?
*MOT: um I dunno I was trying he we have a dog at home and hes kind obsessed with dogs so I thought he might take more interest than he did in the dogs .
*MOT: um I dont really think .
*MOT: um he liked the zebra .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um which is funny because sometimes I think he confuses zebras and horses so .
*MOT: um yeah I guess the zebra was one thing he did pick out .
*EXP: is there anything here that he might have something similar to ?
*MOT: he has a bigger version of this WinniethePooh at home .
*MOT: um in terms of stuffed animals .
*MOT: um we have a book thats sort of li I dont think its its baby animals .
*MOT: its the same um thing in the series I guess its different than this book .
*MOT: um and we have some KarenKatz but we dont have that one .
*MOT: um and we dont have any pretend food at home .
*EXP: does he like when you read to him ?
*EXP: do you do that a lot or ?
*MOT: yeah we do it a lot .
*MOT: we um we do it always before he sleeps bedtime and naptime but also throughout the day I have a bookcase that just has books so he will grab whatever he wants to read and bring it over and just plop .
*MOT: hell sometimes he likes to throw the book in my lap .
*MOT: or in his dads lap and then just like back into our laps like here I wanna read this and then hell sit down and relax .
*MOT: so yeah he likes to read .
*EXP: does he have any food that her played with that he might have at home that you might eat or ?
*MOT: no food is tricky with us because he has a lot of um food sensitivities or its not allergies I guess theres theyre theyre just calling it a sensitivity that he might grow out of .
*MOT: so um like we dont have pizza at home because he cant eat it .
*MOT: um he has a lot of issues so .
*MOT: um he .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: he probably wouldnt really recognize a lot of the stuff .
*MOT: unfortunately .
*EXP: does he hold like utensils at home ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: mhm yeah .
*EXP: xxx like that .
*MOT: um mainl we dont give him forks a lot of the time but its spoons and bowls yeah .

*MOT: um and like I said Im always trying to get him to play with .
*MOT: because I dont want him to be like stereotypically boy car ball obsessed but that is kind of the way its happening .
*MOT: um so yeah Ill try to like okay rock the baby burp the baby feed the baby and that kind of thing but hes kind of a little bit more interested in other things .
*MOT: he has .
*MOT: oh the other things he has that are kind of like um babies are little sesame street characters that I like wrap them up in blankets and youknow show him like that how to nurture a baby .
*EXP: does he have maybe like a favorite color that he kind of seemed to find some stuff that was the same color or anything like that ?
