*EXP: yeah a lot of babies do for some reason .
*EXP: um do you have any ideas why hes attracted to that more ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: um well I probably because its little .

*MOT: I think might be why .
*MOT: and its easy to put in his mouth .
*MOT: right ?
*EXP: he knows what thats for .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and um okay so you thought he he was more interested in these .
*MOT: he seemed to focus more on that .

*MOT: but um when it was there yeah .
*EXP: does he have any babies at home ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: well Imean he has a couple like stuffed ones .
*MOT: but nothing that looks as real I guess as that .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and so he just went over to it ?
*EXP: or did you show him or ?
*MOT: I think he went over to it initially .
*MOT: um and then later on I brought it over to him .
*EXP: and then was he um feeding the baby or just ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: poking at it .
*EXP: looking at the face .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*EXP: we see that a lot .
*MOT: was he interested in any of the animals ?

*MOT: and he didnt seem to really .
*MOT: well now he does .
*EXP: they dont have a really good place to hold on a rattle I guess .
*EXP: they have a small thing at the end .

*MOT: from here ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: um I think hes more interesting in this that he can hold in his hands and bang together .
*MOT: and then he seemed to like I think the texture here of of something like this .
*MOT: you gonna eat that ?
*MOT: huh ?
*EXP: how about in terms of home ?
*EXP: what does he like the most of toys ?
*MOT: um blocks and um cups .
*MOT: he likes cups a lot .
*MOT: um that but more if you build them up hell knock them down .
*MOT: and he likes to bang them together .
*MOT: hes not um youknow putting things in them or or pouring things out of them .
*MOT: he likes things that he can shake too .
*MOT: rattles he tends to go to those .
*MOT: things that make noise too .
*EXP: yes you do like that .
*EXP: um which of the toys here do you think interested him the least ?
*MOT: the animals .
*EXP: animals .
*MOT: yeah the stuffed animals .
*EXP: does he have any of those at home ?
*MOT: he has a few but not very many so .
*EXP: and how does he .
*MOT: he doesnt usually pay much attention .
*MOT: when theyre new when they first come out he will .
*MOT: and then they tend to be put away .
*MOT: he doesnt or he leaves them in the in his basket .
*MOT: he doesnt pull them out .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: he te hell pull them out .
*MOT: he doesnt play with them I guess I should say .
*MOT: he likes to take things out .
*MOT: and he just sort of tosses it aside .
*EXP: you get the feeling it could be anything .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: lets see .
*EXP: so do you think his interest in type of toy has changed since the last time ?
*MOT: um yeah .
*MOT: I think .
*MOT: well .
*MOT: no he seems to be playing with the same toys just in a more purposeful way .
*EXP: great .
*EXP: um you said he has a baby at home and plays with it .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: he turns pages of the board book .
*EXP: and does he have kitchen and food items like that at home like we have here ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: uhuh he doesnt have those .
*MOT: and youknow I I dont know so much that its board books that hes able to manipulate .
*MOT: its more the bath books .
*MOT: those are the ones that I see him kinda turning um more so um now that I think about it .
*EXP: okay theyre the ones you mean .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: the plasticy ones ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: the the ones that can go right in .
*MOT: because he these are I think harder for him .
*MOT: hell if hes sitting on your lap hell try to turn it .
*MOT: but its usually many pages at once that get turned .
*MOT: you want that .
*EXP: what does when he plays with the baby what does he like to do ?
*MOT: hell hold it up .
*MOT: and um a lot of times hell uh put the feet or the hands in his mouth .
*MOT: hell babble to it .
*MOT: um hell give it um sometimes if you tell him give the baby a hug hell youknow bring it to him .
*MOT: um he puts his mouth on the head .
*MOT: which we say hes kissing it but I dont know that that he is .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: what ?
*MOT: cant get up ?
*MOT: push .
*EXP: thats interesting because a lot of the kids at this age dont like the baby .
*MOT: oh really ?
*EXP: so thats interesting yeah .
*EXP: um okay does he so he doesnt sound like he is feeding the baby or .
*MOT: no he doesnt do things like that .
*EXP: um and then I think the last thing is at this point do you think he recognizes the names of any of the items here or beginning to recognize any names ?
*MOT: the the objects that are here ?
*MOT: um no .
*MOT: probably not .
*MOT: maybe the baby a little bit because .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: um more so at home though I think if you say that he does know which is his baby .
*EXP: the toys that he has at home .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: a ba the babys probably the only one that he really um sort of knows and not not consistently I wouldnt say .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: I think thats about it .
*EXP: is there anything that I didnt ask you that you think would be helpful to know about how he plays or what he plays with at this stage ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: no this is pre .
*EXP: hes happy playing um by himself ?
*MOT: he is .
*MOT: hes pretty good about that .
*MOT: and hes um he um I I noticed he doesnt hes quiet a lot of times when hes playing .
*MOT: um whereas if hes in the car he makes he seems to make more noises and more babbling .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but he seems quiet when he gets new toys and things like that very focused on them and .
*MOT: and he can he can sit for entertain himself it seems like .
*EXP: thats great .
*EXP: xxx big boy .
*EXP: okay well thats all I hadta ask you .
*EXP: now I dont do you remember what um he primarily played with last time you were here ?
*MOT: yeah it was I think he did more of the stuffed animals .
*MOT: and the baby .
*MOT: he always goes to the baby .
*EXP: do you think he remembers it in particular ?
*MOT: um he has one at home .
*MOT: so I dont know if he remembers this particular baby .
*MOT: but he does have a doll at home that he likes to play with so .
*EXP: are there other things here that are like what you have at home ?
*MOT: um he has some stuffed animals .
*MOT: but he doesnt really pay much attention to them .
*MOT: he has books at home um that he likes to look through .
*MOT: and hell listen to a short story usually .
*MOT: the plates .
*EXP: um did he play as much with the food items before ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: he didnt .
*MOT: I think he spent more time today with the food items than he did previously .
*EXP: do you think theres anything there that hed recognize ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: probably not because hes not a good eater .
*MOT: so he .
*MOT: no the only thing I he did seem to he could kinda match if I shh youknow showed him .
*MOT: he did like to hold things that were the same .
*MOT: but I dont think he really knows what they are because he really doesnt hes not a good eater .
*EXP: so mostly looking for things that came for which there were there were pairs .
*MOT: yeah or were similar um in shape I think .
*MOT: he had youknow or youknow like he would pick up the two spoons or .
*MOT: where you going ?
*EXP: do you think there was anything else among those that made them particularly interesting ?
*MOT: um of the foods I think well the bottle because hes useta those .
*MOT: so he did that .
*MOT: um and I think to put the cookie in here .
*MOT: he was trying to get it out .

*MOT: things like that .
*MOT: or um pictures of real animals he seems to focus on more uh than drawings .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and all of those are yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: that seems to be what hes doing now .

*MOT: yeah he seems to be um its more purposeful now .
*MOT: youknow hes putting things in um taking things out .
*MOT: um he has a stacked ring thing now that he puts things o um hell put the rings on .
*MOT: and also more frustration .
*MOT: like if he has um a train that balls go in hell try to put blocks in it .
*MOT: if they dont go in it makes him angry .

*MOT: um so .
*MOT: yeah I think hes more purposeful .
*MOT: he loves balls .
