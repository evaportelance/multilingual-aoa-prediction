*EXP: okay .
*MOT: I dont know if its a novelty thing or if its a .
*MOT: hes at that age where hes discovering foods and he recognizes them .
*EXP: thats yeah I was curious about that um are any of these things um .
*EXP: foods or items that he might recognize from home or from .
*MOT: youknow what ?
*MOT: we dont really eat cookies and .
*MOT: like this might look like yogurt he does yogurt .
*EXP: but he .
*MOT: but he definitely doesnt eat meat and we very rarely eat hamburgers like .
*MOT: he just I think he recognizes it as food though like when I bring out new foods at home .
*MOT: he automatically knows that its food .
*MOT: even when its not offered to him .
*EXP: and so he would know yogurt but he wouldnt know icecream .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: hes never had that before .
*MOT: unhunh .
*MOT: and he may have hes seen us eat icecream before though .
*EXP: and so none of these other things either .
*EXP: or did you see some ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: he like he looked .
*MOT: I didnt offer him anything I offered him like the peas and he was not that interested .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: hes more interested in the hamburger like he grabbed it and tried to eat it versus youknow like this which he looked at and then just set it down .
*MOT: he didnt I dont know .
*EXP: uhuh .
*MOT: so I dont know if its a texture thing it feels like food .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: tried to drink the juice .
*MOT: are you being shy ?
*MOT: you being shy ?
*EXP: so those are the main items that he looked at was um the ones you already mentioned ?
*MOT: this ones for Mommy .
*MOT: yeah the cookie is the main one .
*EXP: the main one okay .
*MOT: each time its been the cookie .
*MOT: oops oops oops oops oops xxx this ones for Mommy .
*EXP: do you think is there any reason do you think he likes that one in particular ?
*MOT: no idea .
*MOT: uh it could be because of because its something he can hold in his hand .
*MOT: this .
*MOT: uhuh .
*MOT: you think its the right size ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I think its partially that its kindof colorful .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: its colorful .
*EXP: did you do any InAndOut games ?
*EXP: like um some kids will put drop things into the pitcher .
*MOT: into the pitcher no not yet .
*EXP: is he making noise with something ?
*EXP: I cant remember if he was .
*MOT: with the book he started talking with the book .
*MOT: Im trying to think with the foods hes talking to the pitcher also .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: he really likes the pitcher he played with the pitcher every time weve come in too .
*EXP: something he was rattling .
*MOT: oh the um spoons .
*MOT: yeah the measuring spoons where are they ?
*EXP: oh okay .
*EXP: oh theyre there .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: he still has them .
*EXP: he liked those .
*EXP: so he likes things that he can do shake like that .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: oh I see .
*EXP: and then he did pay attention to some of the books right ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: and first thing he did he kindof took inventory .
*MOT: and then he stopped and looked at the books .
*MOT: like he was thinking about it and then hes like no Im gonna go for the food .
*MOT: and he kept stopping and looking at the books and hes like no theres not enough time .
*MOT: I gotta get to the food what are you doing ?
*MOT: what are you doing ?
*MOT: are you just lounging ?
*EXP: silly .
*MOT: yeah are you being silly ?
*EXP: so does he like books ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: yeah because his brother does .
*MOT: yeah his favorite books are .
*MOT: like anything we have with um .
*MOT: that are like really short but still have kind of .
*MOT: some sort of plot like if its just picture picture picture hes not as interested in it .
*EXP: uhuh .
*MOT: or anything even if its nonsensical that has photography with babies .
*MOT: like .
*EXP: oh interesting .
*MOT: very interested in other little kids .
*MOT: very interested .
*EXP: so did he pay any attention to ours ?
*MOT: thats why I tried to get him to play with the baby and he was not interested .
*EXP: he did look at her .
*MOT: he looked at her .
*MOT: the baby .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: xxx does he do that ?
*MOT: yep .
*MOT: play peekaboo where are you ?
*EXP: do you guys play .
*MOT: peekaboo .
*EXP: do you guys do that kind of game at home ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: so hes done that before .
*MOT: yeah but usually he always waits for me to initiate it I think maybe because its a peekaboo book we just played we just read .
*MOT: but normally I hafta initiate it and quite often he waits for me to do the work .
*MOT: those things Im like I see this as a pattern with both of my male children is it a .
*MOT: a boy thing .
*EXP: uhuh .
*MOT: wait for Mom to initiate it yeah .
*EXP: uhuh .
*MOT: and then you can do the work .
*MOT: you do it .
*EXP: at least in my experience .
*MOT: oh were losing our microphone cover .
*EXP: and then um I wanted to ask about the animals was he interested at all in the animals ?
*MOT: I tried making noises with them and sta and he just he wouldnt even look at them .
*EXP: no okay .
*EXP: and then um .
*MOT: and hes hes been around a few animals and hes very scared of them so I think that might be part of why hes not interested in stuffed animals yet .
*EXP: oh okay .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: I was thinking the dog which actually looks enough like the dog that we have that hes had interactions with that I though he would recognize but .
*EXP: no ?
*MOT: nope .
*EXP: so he might know the name though .
*MOT: he might know dog and he knows .
*MOT: um pictures weve done pictures of and associating sounds with cows sheep ducks and horses and he seems to recognize those and anticipate those .
*EXP: frog too ?
*MOT: I dont think frog yet .
*EXP: um and probably not any of the more unusual animals that you have there .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I was gonna say some of these I know we havent even xxx .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: hi are you just kinda sleepy youre gonna put yourself to sleep ?
*EXP: well lets see if theres anything I think that might be it .
