*MOT: I think you get to keep playing .
*EXP: which toys do you think Asher was interested in ?
*MOT: definitely interested in the food .
*MOT: yeah hes been that way uh .
*MOT: all three times .
*MOT: and he also likes the baby .
*MOT: and the bottle anything plastic that he can chew on .
*EXP: so would you say that um his interests really havent changed since the last time of which toys that hes gone to ?
*EXP: was there anything that was new or that he didnt go to .
*MOT: he .
*MOT: his interests have pretty much stayed the same .
*MOT: hes more interested in the baby and feeding the baby than he was last time .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: that was new .
*MOT: but for the most part yeah he paid some attention to the books and alot of attention to the food and .
*EXP: would this are these the type of things that he has at home ?
*MOT: um he does not not have any plastic food at home .
*MOT: he does have some stuffed animals he does not have a babydoll .
*MOT: lots of foods so .
*MOT: some of each I guess .
*EXP: yeah ?
*MOT: Imean he has he doesnt have food but he has lots of plastic things that he likes to stick in his mouth so .
*MOT: similar .
*EXP: now the books was it mostly just you picking up a book or do any of them he wanted to go to ?
*MOT: it was mostly just me uh .
*MOT: which is interesting at home he loves books and here hes not as interested he doesnt really .
*MOT: he didnt really go to any of them .
*MOT: but like the TouchAndFeel one he played with for a little bit and felt the appropriate .
*EXP: do you have books like that at home ?
*MOT: little circle .
*MOT: mhm yes .
*MOT: he does .
*MOT: yup .
*MOT: he really does look at xxx .
*EXP: so .
*MOT: ah hi .
*EXP: you mentioned he has alot of books at home is that mostly what he plays with or you also like what would be his most the thing that he plays with the most at home ?
*MOT: what he plays with at home is everything hes not sposta hes more interested in Mommy and Daddys stuff than he is in his own stuff but .
*MOT: uh with his toys he has like uh .
*MOT: he has some plastic nesting cups youknow that kindof fit inside eachother and stack up and he really likes those .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: uhoh you dont wanna step on the xxx .

*MOT: sorry .
*MOT: boo .
*MOT: oh and he uh .
*MOT: but he likes his books alot at home he plays with uh .
*MOT: he has a few uh like a stacker toy .
*MOT: but he likes that although mainly the pulling it apart but .
*EXP: um so you mentioned he liked the food alot but he doesnt have those types of things at home but do you think that he recognized any of them as the food like does he eat any of those .
*MOT: yeah we have we do waffles and peas and he eats those I think he might recognize those .
*MOT: uh the pizza I think he mainly likes the fun shape to it .
*MOT: but uh .
*MOT: because hes never really eaten pizza before hes seen it .
*MOT: but he hasnt eaten a whole lot of it so .
*MOT: yeah I think he does actually recognize it as food .
*MOT: I dont think he did the first couple of times .
*MOT: but now I think he does make more of an association .
*MOT: oh is that locked ?
*MOT: so he cant get that open .
*EXP: I think so .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: um now you when you were playing with him you said alot of the names out loud do you think he recognizes theses names like the things you were saying do you think he .
