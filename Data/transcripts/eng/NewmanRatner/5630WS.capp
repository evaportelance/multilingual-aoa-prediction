*EXP: does he um have any favorite animals ?
*MOT: he is really into he really likes dogs and cats I think is sort of probably .
*MOT: he has a teddy bear that he sleeps with but I think in terms of ones that he talks about probably dogs and cats .
*MOT: probably dog would be if he had a favorite .
*MOT: um that was probably what would be what he would pick .
*EXP: does he have so he has mostly stuffed animal toys at home ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah we dont have any toys like this .
*EXP: what of these animals would he have seen in real life ?
*MOT: um in real life lets see .
*MOT: weve seen some animals like the fish kinds of things in some aquariums but its been a while since weve been to an aquarium .
*MOT: but he might Imean .
*EXP: have you ever been any place to see animals ?
*MOT: well yeah weve been to the zoo but we havent been since like last summer youknow ?
*MOT: um hes seen a lot of them probably in books like the the panda um he might recog .
*MOT: and these .
*MOT: okay well hes seen at the um super market .
*MOT: uh hes seen pigs and sheeps and uh cats and dogs at the frying pan farm .
*EXP: ah .
*MOT: um its the park out in like McClain Virginia side of things .
*MOT: they have a sort of like a little form with cow horse goat pig kind of stuff .
*MOT: so um lets see .
*MOT: but also we havent been there since like last summer .
*MOT: and the most recently probably the only thing hes seen are like cats and dogs .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: he uh learns a lot from his brother .
*EXP: because he knows what to make them do .
*MOT: uhhuh .
*EXP: I think he had them xxx there was some jumping and some .
*MOT: yeah flying and swimming and .
*EXP: does he like to swim himself ?
*MOT: uh he well his brothers learning swim has is in swim lessons right now .
*MOT: um hes been in the pool a few times we have a pool with the gym but uh .
*MOT: he doesnt mind the water .
*MOT: I wouldnt know that he I would say that he likes it .
*MOT: but he hasnt been it in a again we havent done that since like last summer .
*EXP: its far away now its like February .
*MOT: so its sort of like does he remember that ?
*MOT: maybe .
*EXP: are there any of these animals that you think that um he saw for the first time here .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: yes hes never seen an ostrich before even in a book Im pretty certain .
*MOT: um the dolphin he has seen in the we have this like endless ocean video game on the Wii and so that has like a lot of fish .
*MOT: so I dont know if that counts as like seeing for the first time .
*EXP: well .
*MOT: so things that youve been observed exposed to in books or movies .
*EXP: or the things that .
*EXP: yeah or things that you named for him that you dont think he knew .
*MOT: uh that hed never heard the name before ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: I dont think hed ever .
*MOT: oh kangaroo .
*MOT: well actually possibly with WinniethePooh we might have talked about kangaroos .
*MOT: um lets see .
*MOT: did I call the macaw a macaw or did I just call it a bird I think I might have just called it a bird .
*MOT: um the anteater .
*MOT: thats definitely a new one .
*EXP: ah .
*MOT: um the beaver the beaver Im pretty sure is new .
*MOT: the moose it not because we went to the Tetons last summer so we talked a lot about moose last summer .
*MOT: um the orangutan when I called it that hes not heard that word before but then I called it a monkey .
*MOT: I changed it .
*MOT: so he has heard weve talked about monkeys .
*MOT: lets see what else did he pick up ?
*MOT: um ostrich is new I think I mentioned that one .
*EXP: he really was animal centered today .
*MOT: yeah we did a we did a lot of animals and then at the very end switched to food .
*MOT: but pretty much in every play thing that weve done here with this um longitudinal study whatever hes started with thats been like what weve played with most of the time and then at the end hes like moving to something else .
*MOT: so um .
*MOT: I dunno .
*MOT: I think he tends to like play with one thing for youknow ten minutes or something before .
*EXP: thats amazing hes able to keep a focus for xxx .
*MOT: before um going on to something else so .
*MOT: but he does like animals .
*MOT: because he had at that point he had a choice of the dolls and the puzzles and the animals .
*EXP: is he um does he like to play with cooking things at home ?
*MOT: we do have cooking stuff at home yes .
*MOT: um and he does like to play with it .
*MOT: so much so and his brother likes to play with it so much so that its a reinforcer for potty training so its not always out .
*EXP: oh really ?
*MOT: something thats earned for like a certain number of days of potty training so .
*EXP: and does he have his own like cooking utensils or ?
*MOT: we yeah .
*MOT: Imean its theyre not his own its all kind of shared with his brother .
*MOT: but yeah we have pots and pans and stuff like that so .
*MOT: pots and pans and um fruit and vegetables .
*MOT: and some of the fruits and vegetables you can pretend to like cut them up and things like that so .
*EXP: mhm the nice ones .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: right yeah .
*MOT: and the pots and pans actually we havent done it but theyre sposta be you can cook them on the stove but theyre like little child sized ones .
*EXP: oh wow .
*EXP: thats exciting .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: although .
*MOT: but I think they hafta be a little older for that .
*EXP: but once you start .
*MOT: I know .
*EXP: it may be that its hard to uh .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: so I havent started that yet .
*EXP: and is there anything that he plays a lot at home that we havent really seen here ?
*MOT: cars trains planes .
*MOT: all that transportation stuff is what we do most of the time .
*MOT: thats most of our time and reading books .
*MOT: thats what we mostly play at home .
*EXP: yeah that makes sense he seemed to really enjoy the story .
*MOT: oh yeah yeah we do a lot of reading .
*MOT: um especially now the trains and cars are also part of the .
*MOT: pretty much all toys have been removed with the exception of a few small toys and then books while were doing potty training so thats kind of like what we do most of the time .
*EXP: ah .
*MOT: because were really my older child hes very admirable but he has a lot of time hard time focusing and like stopping to go to the bathroom and so were like well if youre not gonna stop playing to go to the bathroom then were gonna stop playing .
*MOT: until youve learned this .
*EXP: so much harder in winter too huh ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I dunno .
*MOT: potty training has been very difficult for him .
*MOT: hes really advanced in a lot of other ways .
*MOT: so that sort of effects what toys Wes has available because theyre all really close together .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: that makes sense .
*EXP: is there anything that youd like me about anything weve done today really ?
*MOT: so his articulation is the thing thats been kind of concerning to me its feels like he has the vocabulary thats kind of age appropriate but that a lot of times when Ill say something and ask him to repeat it he drops a lot of consonants .
*MOT: I think its hard for other people to understand him .
*MOT: hes starting to get frustrated and sometimes hell start screaming if he says something and I dont really know what hes asking for .
*MOT: so thats kind of the one thing that .
*MOT: and I was wondering if maybe theres like if hes not hearing like low tones or something if theres like a hearing problem .
*EXP: does he have a history of ear infections ?
*MOT: hes had a few but not like so many that hes had tubes in his ears or anything hes had like two or three .
*MOT: so not like so much that the doctors been really concerned .
*EXP: most people too youknow ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: I guess we dont really know .
*EXP: um yeah we needta sit down with the forms and look very carefully but I hafta say that I thought I was finished with the pointing thing and he was I thought looking very carefully most of the time and making informed choices .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and looking very satisfied .
*EXP: like oh yeah thats a .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and I I had not expected to get as far as we did .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: based on the other one .
*MOT: uhhuh .
*EXP: we did also see that um he was willing to repeat some things for me .
*MOT: uhhuh .
*EXP: but um those are arranged in one syllable two syllable and three syllable .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: and most kids wont many many kids are nana kids .
*MOT: uhhuh .
*EXP: but you could also really see that for him that oh you just said how many lady xxx youknow ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah banana hes said nana for a long and Ive been trying to get him to say banana .
*EXP: no thats really normal .
*MOT: but .
*EXP: but you could see that as they got phonologically harder to produce he was less willing to give it a try .
