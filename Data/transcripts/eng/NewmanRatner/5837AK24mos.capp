*EXP: because .
*MOT: he had an evaluation for the MontgomeryCounty and he did not I dont think he put more than two or three one inch blocks .

*EXP: yeah he pulled it out very nonchalantly for me .
*MOT: yeah yeah .
*EXP: that was fun .
*MOT: we just learned that yyy .
*MOT: youknow its been there the whole time and he just was youknow not in the mood to spin able to score youknow or make a train for me .
*MOT: yyy yyy on yyy of the house .
*EXP: he does like to be the one driving .
*MOT: he does .
*MOT: he does yeah .
*EXP: choosing the activity and um .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: how its gonna go .
*EXP: and he communicates that very beautifully exactly what .
*MOT: and I might youknow and I certainly have encouraged it I guess .
*MOT: maybe indirectly I dont know and then just the beginning of his playing I wouldnt I would wait for his cue and I wouldnt say back before he and I wouldnt say this is a red something or other or this is a I would just .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: let him make whatever he wanted .
*MOT: um was our initial play .
*MOT: until he started naming things on youknow xxx that was then and I started naming things back to him but .
*EXP: now you said that InfantsandToddlers has been to evaluate him ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: but you .
*MOT: in December and they are accepting into his into their program .
*MOT: they said he has a mild they think he has a mild delay .
*MOT: of making sounds .
*MOT: um and um that um .
*MOT: theyre gonna work with him two times uh a month .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: for six months .
*MOT: and .
*MOT: Imean Im gonna work with him but .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: yeah thats the .
*MOT: and then but um .
*MOT: so um he had had incredibly bad reflux when he was a newborn and .
*MOT: for six months and um .
*MOT: uh we didnt know first it seemed like it was a cold .
*MOT: um but he never spit and I thought cool a baby that doesnt spit up right ?
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: I mean how lucky can I get ?
*MOT: and then he just got more and more congested and um and then it hed stop breathing five or six times .
*EXP: how scary .
*MOT: and I would get the little aspirator thing and xxx of mucus would thick mucus and as soon as I pulled it out it was like .
*MOT: youknow um .
*MOT: and so finally uh uh I brought him to the pediatrician .
*MOT: um once and then I brought him back again they said it was cold brought it back again and I said I am in such sleep deprivation from youknow keeping away and it could happen during the night too and whats the sound of not breathing its yyy youknow .
*EXP: how frightening .
*MOT: unless you can hear his body banging and you throw his head back .
*MOT: and xxx bang he was on something that made noise you knew and if it was just on youknow like a mattress .
*EXP: oh gosh .
*MOT: so he slept in the crook of my arm for many weeks .
*MOT: um just so I could feel it .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: youknow the tenseness .
*MOT: and he they rushed him to the hospital .
*MOT: office visit and he just xxx this is not good because hes working too hard to breathe and .
*MOT: and then he stopped breathing in the ambulance and then I was surprised that the ambulance did not have or initiate any kind of .
*MOT: extraction mechanism Imean .
*MOT: they had an oxygen tank there but if he cant get it in .
*MOT: youknow reach into the diaper bag and go like why did I call the ambulance I couldve just done this .
*MOT: um and I couldnt get it out though .
*MOT: and then we took him to yyy the hospital and they had some super duper suction thing .
*MOT: and yyy yyy picking it up and then I took him to Childrens .
*MOT: they examined and well I said he had the reflux that that hes spitting up .
*MOT: out your mouth goes up into your sinuses and your nasal cavity and it just irritates it and inflames it so that .
*EXP: oh my goodness .
*MOT: youknow a little bit of mucus hardens and it it blocks blocks up then your airways and something I didnt know .
*MOT: infants atleast under six months do not breathe through their mouths .
*MOT: well no they can I mean its open but its some sort of thing with suckling and youknow being able to swallow and it not interfere with breathing .
*EXP: can .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: yes .
*MOT: so if their nose is stuffed up .
*MOT: they dont breathe .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: anyway so when InfantsandToddlers came they asked me about that and they said there is some type of correlation between this type of reflux and delayed speech .
*EXP: hm .
*MOT: um and they didnt know what the reason was um .
*MOT: and youknow it was slightly muscular .
*MOT: I dont know some other correlation so .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: think wed work with him for awhile .
*EXP: well that thats lovely .
*EXP: he seems to be hungry for labels .
*EXP: I felt like a weenie when I kept asking him what things were and he would repeat what I just said .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: youknow I thought youknow heres a child whos working on this and my book thing thats standardized .
*MOT: yeah yeah .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: doesnt provide for that .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: but um so thats great youknow he wants to know those labels .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um when he started to his kindof generalized labels .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: thats like kindof early earlier language development thing where Im gonna I wanna talk about all these things I can use ball .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and I have he has a whole series of cars .
*MOT: right right .
*EXP: and a whole series of dogs it seemed like too .
*EXP: where he needs a label hes reaching for one .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and hasnt yet got the precise ones that are gonna fit for him .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: but um .
*EXP: but looks like hes looking for them so thats lovely .
*MOT: yeah he is and I youknow and she said to me maybe if we did nothing at all youknow it would he would just sortof youknow go into the next phase just maybe a little later .
*MOT: uh but um talked about frustration .
*EXP: mm .
*MOT: youknow the problems of if he gets frustrated and then that might delay the speech further because then he wont wanna talk and if he gets frustrated and then he cant say the word youknow xxx .
*MOT: and so were just trying to bypass youknow frustration by working on it .
*MOT: so that he can have possibly youknow have speech a little earlier than xxx .
*MOT: so how old was he when he had that hospital trip ?
*MOT: I think a month and a half maybe ?
*EXP: so he was little little .
*EXP: when Imean jeez .
*MOT: yeah he was a tiny little thing .
*MOT: and he youknow its funny he looked very healthy though .
*MOT: I mean he was very robustly built .
*MOT: so you might say that you know so like Id talk to the other moms yeah well hows xxx doing fine etcetera youknow .
*MOT: five times yesterday stopped breathing and yyy yyy .
*MOT: theyd just look at me like .
*MOT: but he looks so healthy .
*MOT: yeah hes eating .
*MOT: maybe they think Im just overreacting .
*MOT: but um .
*EXP: well how are you sposta yeah that sounds like it was rough time .
*MOT: it .
*EXP: gosh .
*MOT: yeah it was very frightening because um .
*MOT: youknow I had never heard of this reflux before .
*MOT: so I wasnt working on any other cues except hes got a really bad cold and then when it int went it into stop breathing .
*MOT: whatever it is even if its a really bad cold .
*MOT: and hes not breathing from it and thats still youknow .
*EXP: but you dont know my sisters son h has um had croup .
*EXP: and half the time theyre like why are you here in the emergency room and the other half of the time theyre like well you left this late .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and she cant predict .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: which nurse which reaction which .
*MOT: right right right .
*EXP: so thats okay you know what ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah I youknow theres always time to say oh Im sorry that youknow we youknow overreact I dont youknow ?
*EXP: nevermind .
*EXP: absolutely .
*MOT: its like alright well thats why Im coming here so you can tell you can correct me if I need correction I dont mind but .
*EXP: do you have any questions about any of the things we did ?
*EXP: during the course of the morning ?
*MOT: well youknow just I guess youknow in a question about setting up the experiment and trying to figure out what kind of information youre getting .
*MOT: um youknow when he when you turn the page and there was a bicycle there .
*MOT: I mean he just loves bikes right ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so I think how do you know when a child is answering your question or .
*MOT: youknow is gravitating to the thing thats interesting to him .
*EXP: yeah well its hard .
*EXP: well it was hard with the vocabulary test this way .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: because really the first time I got things out he was pointing .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: to the thing he liked .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: the car not the airplane .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: so I think that on that one in particular there was also how does a two year old tell you he doesnt know ?
*MOT: thats yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: none of them they dont theyre bad guessers .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: many wont guess .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: they dont say I dont know .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: so its always kindof a read .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: that were youknow were hoping for .
*EXP: and we know that youknow if he had something different for breakfast or youknow if it were a different day of the week .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: it could be .
*EXP: it is bedtime that all of things really change how an individual child does and we hope by doing many many .
*EXP: that were able to see some things .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and thats an average in itself .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: I have um for the very end I have two more permission slips for you .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: I wonder about that myself too .
*MOT: my default it usually just comes out how I would talk to any other person .
*MOT: unless hes actively trying to say something .
