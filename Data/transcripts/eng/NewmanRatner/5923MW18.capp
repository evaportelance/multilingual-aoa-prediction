*EXP: alrighty I can ask you some questions and then xxx .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: um so just generally um tell me about what kind of toys you played with today .
*MOT: well um he played with the pretend food .
*MOT: and the books a little bit .
*MOT: and the baby doll a little bit .
*MOT: and the clock .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um and what kind of things did he do with them ?
*MOT: he moved a lot of the toys from one part of the room to the other .
*MOT: into a pile .
*MOT: um he wanted the doll to chew on his foot .
*MOT: he didnt seem that interested in reading the books for the most part .
*MOT: just kind of looking at them and moving them around .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um what kind of toys did did you see a change between the last times that he came in and this time ?
*MOT: if I can remember that far back .
*MOT: um some of the things he did were the same like before he also tried to move a lot of toys from one part of the room to the other .
*MOT: but some of the things were different like wanting the shoe to go on the baby doll .
*MOT: and he seemed more interested in the I guess the details of some of the toys like that this came apart .
*MOT: and he was trying to take the lid off the peanutbutter jar .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: which doesnt come off but .
*MOT: and I dont recall him doing those things before .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um are there any toys you said he wasnt interested in any books anything else that he wasnt particularly interested in ?
*MOT: the stuffed animals .
*MOT: he did a little bit of moving some of these things .
*MOT: but he mostly ignored the stuffed animals .
*MOT: which is also what he does at home .
*MOT: hes not that interested in stuffed animals at this point .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um do you think that he recognizes the names of any of these items ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: some of them .
*EXP: which ones do you think ?
*MOT: um like the doll just book in general .
*MOT: um probably like he knows what real bread is so he probably recognized that as bread .
*MOT: cup spoon things like that .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um is he able to say any of these items or no ?
*MOT: hes not .
*MOT: he doesnt really say very many words .
*MOT: yet at this point .
*MOT: but he he recog he know his comprehension is a lot better than his production at this point so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um so he played pretty similarly here to as how he plays at home ?
*MOT: um yeah for the most part .
*MOT: except he stayed in one spot .
*MOT: more than he would at home .
*MOT: and he is more interested in boo I guess because theyre the books that are familiar to him but at home he carries the books around and asks us to read them to him and hes more .
*MOT: but theyre also a lot of new toys here so .
*MOT: that may be why he ignored the books today .
*MOT: and he doesnt have pretend food at home either .
*MOT: so that could be the the draw of the novelty of that .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: is there anything else youd like to add ?
*MOT: um I dont think so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: then were done with this .
