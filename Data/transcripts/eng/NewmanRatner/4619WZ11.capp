*MOT: I mean th the juice and the sippycups .
*EXP: do you think he recognizes the .
*MOT: oh yeah that its a yeah I mean definitely .
*MOT: he wasnt getting anything out of it but he certainly recognizes that it was something to drink .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: what other were there any other toys that you thought .
*MOT: that he liked or ?
*EXP: that he liked or preferred of of the other toys ?
*MOT: I think he had fun with the food toys we dont um .
*MOT: what else ?
*MOT: the I mean it seemed evident that the icecream cone was a hit .
*MOT: what else did he like to play with ?
*MOT: th the blocks these little things when we made a little tower that seemed like it was good fun .
*MOT: and um .
*MOT: I think thats probably maybe the baby he definitely liked looking at he likes to look at paybee babies and point to their features and .
*MOT: didnt seem that interested in the book but we have a similar Karen Katz book that hes interested that he likes to look at the babies in so the doll .
*EXP: do you have dolls at home ?
*MOT: we have um one little doll he doesnt give a whole lot of attention to .
*MOT: its um but um but books with babys in it .
*MOT: and he has a little he has a big brother that he plays with all the time so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and the books um does he prefer books over toys ?
*MOT: I dont think so I think generally toys over books now at this point .
*MOT: so hes um .
*MOT: and it doesnt doesnt hafta be a youknow he doesnt obviously use the toy in the intended way at this point anyway generally .
*MOT: but um any things toys measuring spoons .
*MOT: bowls .
*MOT: keys .
*MOT: rocks youknow .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: does he do you think he recognized the activity of that book that you read him ?

*EXP: felt that he was not .
*MOT: not terribly interested in .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: um not in particular I think hed be interested in anything .
*MOT: theres a lot of toys here .
*MOT: so I think when when .
*MOT: I j I often find youknow if theres just one toy he would be youknow if if I were interacting with him with it he would probably be a lot more interested but theres a lot of toys here so .
*MOT: I think um any toy I think here he would probably interested in if there werent other things to .
*MOT: to distract him from do you know what I mean ?
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: and the animals toys did you use any of the .
*MOT: not really I think I grabbed a little poodle at the end .
*MOT: but he he doesnt hes not terribly interested in the animal toys .
*MOT: I mean we have some stuffed animals but I dont notice him ever hes never taken like a special a special little youknow stuffed animal to bed or hes not attached to anything like that .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: you mentioned you had the doll .
*MOT: we have one doll it doesnt look anything like that I would say its its not its a soft doll with a flat face thats much more realistic .
*MOT: but yes we do have a my my my um my mother gave my first son a doll when he was born so we have that doll kicking around .
