*MOT: umhum um actually most ballet slippers dont have racing stripes on the side .
*MOT: and most tutus dont hafta go on over shoes with racing stripes on the side .
*MOT: but lets see if we can do it because if we did one foot we can probably do the other one .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: now comes the moment of truth does it fit ?
*MOT: ah maybe not .
*MOT: or maybe it just needta come down first .
*MOT: ah you know what ?

*EXP: Im not going to be writing anything down because Ill just transcribe off the recording .
*EXP: okay so the first question is which of the toys seemed to interest her the most ?
*MOT: well she certainly liked the spoons .
*MOT: um she also really liked this bumblebee .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I think those two the most .
*EXP: and which do you think is a good toy for her personality ?
*MOT: ha I think the spoons .
*MOT: she likes banging and slapping .
*MOT: she does that on the water when I take her swimming .
*MOT: splashes it up in her face .
*MOT: doesnt bother her one bit .
*MOT: and she also does that with her puppy .
*MOT: she like hits hits her .
*MOT: haha the we actually have two puppies .
*MOT: but the smaller one doesnt mind Renee doing that at all .
*MOT: and the bigger one just kinda walks away .
*MOT: haha so one where she can be like that is a good toy for Renee .
*MOT: yeah haha .
*EXP: which of the toys seemed to interest her the least ?
*MOT: I think the plain boxes .
*MOT: like this one and this one and this one .
*MOT: these seemed to do nothing for her .
*MOT: I mean there are obviously other ones she ignored .
*MOT: she never picked this up .
*MOT: in terms of the ones she actually looked at and didnt pay attention to ?
*MOT: it would be these .
*EXP: which book did you prefer or which book do you think your child would prefer to read out loud with you ?

*MOT: I picked my favorite .
*MOT: oh I dont know .
*MOT: we do have GoodNightMoon .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: Im gonna guess MisterBrowncanmoo because she seemed to like the sounds .
*MOT: but that could be projecting .

*MOT: I really dont .

*MOT: so shed seen all those before .
*EXP: are there any that she likes to eat ?

*MOT: well she does like icecream .
*MOT: Im not sure shes had an icecream cone though .

*MOT: its be kind of fun to have at home .
*EXP: oh isnt that cute ?
*MOT: we keep trying to rearranging the house trying to make a little more space .
*MOT: and well when our German foreign exchange student leaves there might be room for a toy kitchen .
*EXP: ah .
*MOT: she said yeah for awhile it was really really cute .
*MOT: youd ask her a question shed say yeah .
*EXP: what does she like to do with dolls ?
*MOT: um dress and undress them .
*MOT: I mean I did this one just because it was so tight .
*MOT: but um yeah she likes taking clothes on and off .
*MOT: I think thats the main thing .
*MOT: Ive never seen her rock .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: or even try to feed .
*MOT: yeah the main thing is dressing and undressing .
*EXP: is there anything else she really likes to play with that we didnt see ?
*MOT: she loves basketball .
*MOT: um basically anything you can push or pull .
*MOT: oh she just got a pink roller bag for her second birthday from grandma and grandpa and she pulls it with her everywhere .
*MOT: so she really liked that but even before the pulling was the pushing .
*MOT: she liked pushing her little Tigger plane um and her s .
*EXP: its empty theres nothing in there .
*MOT: her scooter .
*MOT: she would push it when she wasnt riding it shed just like push it around the livingroom .
*MOT: um and of course she had one of those push toys to help learn how to walk that she was doing at six months was really outrageous .
*MOT: and shes continued to play with that as she got bigger but obviously not as much .
*MOT: um what else do you really like doing ?
*MOT: trying to think going to the park but youre asking about toys .
*MOT: toys .
*EXP: was there anything here that you tried to get her interested in that didnt like ?
*MOT: she didnt seem that interested in the farm animals at all .
*MOT: um the other thing she does alot at home is um talk on the telephone which is frequently a calculator sometimes a cellphone occasionally a blush or an eyeshadow compact .
*MOT: she talks on the phone quites a bit .
*MOT: and she loves dancing .
*MOT: the questionaire asked um what her favorite video and its absolutely without a doubt Sesame Street dance along .
*EXP: oh wow .
*MOT: which is how she got herself signed up for a ballet because alot of the songs on Sesame Street dance along have a good beat which shes loved forever .
*MOT: but theres one thats more elegant and she started doing this stuff completely unprompted .
*MOT: well I cant say completely unprompted obviously theres kids on the video doing slower moves too but she just caught on so fast .
*MOT: so she does she does like watching um watching and doing dancing .
*EXP: what about goodnight moon ?
*MOT: goodnight moon was a favorite too yeah .
*MOT: she likes goodnight moon .
*MOT: she especially likes the three bears and their three chairs .
*EXP: ah .
*MOT: Im not quite sure why thats a favorite page but it .
*MOT: honey ?
*EXP: it isnt everybody who knows our farm book that was a terrific guess .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah she I its funny because I dont actually personally like Margaret Weiss Brown stuff .
*MOT: but she does so theres obviously something about the rhythm that works .
*MOT: and it actually annoys my husband too hes like a quiet egg .
*MOT: and he hates reading her that book and he does it all the time its so funny when she brings it to him hes like .
*MOT: oh big red barn .
*MOT: he just doesnt like that book but hes really really good about it .
*EXP: well thats funny .
*MOT: by heart oh yeah .
*MOT: yeah with my second son it was um choochoo .

*MOT: oh my goodness I cant remember the author right now I cant tell you how many times I read that book .
*MOT: oh he loved that book .
*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: are you going on a trip ?
*EXP: have a good time .
*MOT: she likes purses and she especially likes pink purses so Im afraid shes a bit of a girly girl which I think we can handle .
*MOT: but shes a funny combination of very athletic .
