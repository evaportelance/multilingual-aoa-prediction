*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: I know this was really interesting this one I dont know if its like the texture .
*MOT: the texture book which we dont have I was thinking of actually getting a texture book and I hadnt gotten it yet but my um .
*EXP: mhm .

*MOT: but hes got a Pooh at home and a bear at home .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but he calls it bakbak .

*MOT: so theres nothing wrong with him hes not like a defective baby ?
*EXP: alright .
*EXP: um just kinda like in the past where they just kinda asked you some like questions um .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: so if you just wanna kinda start telling me what you guys started with today .
*MOT: uh we started well he started with the doll .
*MOT: her in particular .
*MOT: um which is kind of interesting because he doesnt really have dolls .
*MOT: he has stuffed animals .
*MOT: and his uh and uh but he does like he treated her the way he treats his stuffed animals where he hugs her and he pets her and he usually wants to xxx .
*MOT: but thats what he does with the the stuffed animals .
*MOT: um if he tries to he he usually um comes to play with me when Im doing something else .
*MOT: so when he went over and thought he wanted to be alone and I started trying to he came back and wanted to read a story so thats yeah I guess thats I dunno if thats I guess thats typical .
*MOT: so as soon as I do something else that doesnt involve him hes fine .
*MOT: um or he comes ba hell come back and and start trying to play with me .
*MOT: um he kinda seemed somewhat interested in these in the beginning but he lost interest pretty quick .
*MOT: food .
*MOT: always a seller .
*MOT: always .
*MOT: play food real food .
*MOT: loves food .
*MOT: um he actually correctly identified four of them and I was sort of surprised at that .
*MOT: um well because we usually just count fingers and that kind of thing and he knows the five fingers but not really youknow not much beyond that .
*MOT: were trying to get him to six and and the above .
*MOT: um I dont think he was really much engaged with anything else he seemed kinda fascinated with the shoes so I kept trying to youknow put them on the where do they go how do they youknow .
*MOT: so they .
*MOT: so uh yeah so the shoes um .
*MOT: so basically I guess mostly more more so the dolls .
*MOT: and the um and the book because he does have the uh the Goodnight Moon book at home so its something that he was familiar with .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: so he he likes to look at that book ?
*MOT: he does look at this book at home .
*MOT: its not his favorite book uh at home but we have read it to him youknow on more than one occasion .
*MOT: um so yeah hes its youknow its just something I think he was familiar with .
*EXP: are there any pictures in there that maybe he likes or does he typically turn to a certain page or ?
*MOT: not with this book no .
*MOT: theres a um a book at home that we usually read its called the PoutPout Fish .
*MOT: and its the face where his the pout pout fish becomes the happy fish so thats usually his favorite page .
*MOT: uh its when he put and then of course the one where hes the where he kisses the other fish and he likes that because I usually kiss him when Im kissing the when we get to that page .
*CHI: I already got one .
*MOT: but .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: you wanna go get them now ?
*MOT: go get them and bring them to mommy .
*MOT: um this was interesting he doesnt have anything at home like this so youknow the fact that he it it seemed engaging for a little while was sort of interesting also so .
*EXP: so he doesnt have anything ?
*MOT: nope .
*MOT: uh he watches my husband do things with tools .
*MOT: so uh but hes never really shown any interest in them .
*MOT: Imean I guess because theyre pro theyre theyre sharp and they are tools so we usually dont have him have him around them but hes ne so hes never really done anything as far that .
*MOT: you realize if you throw it youre gonna hafta go and get it right ?
*EXP: so um I guess of the uh Imean you showed him some animals were there any that he maybe hadnt seen before ?
*MOT: uh theres a lot he hadnt seen before .
*MOT: he hadnt seen this which I think is a beaver .
*MOT: uh he definitely hasnt seen a moose .
*MOT: zebra he was hes familiar with .
*MOT: hes seen an octopus but he didnt really seem so much youknow too much to gravitate to any of them .
*EXP: um and what about Imean he didnt food he wasnt really into but any food that he um hadnt seen before ?
*MOT: yes mommy loves you too .
*MOT: that .
*MOT: the ki I guess the hes never seen it in its uh a kiwi in its uh original form .
*MOT: hes usually by the time he gets it its on a plate and sliced up so .
*MOT: but I think he thinks its a ball .
*MOT: but I think uh no other f no other food .
*MOT: okay now go get it .
*MOT: and try not to .
*MOT: oh thanks .
*MOT: do that .
*EXP: um and you said he doesnt really have dolls at home ?
*MOT: no he only has stuffed animals .
*MOT: bears and a frog and some other items .
*EXP: so this was kind of new for him ?
*MOT: yeah so this was just sort of interesting that he gravitate to the to the doll .
*MOT: my niece sometimes brings dolls to the house .
*MOT: but he never has really shown any interest in them either .
*MOT: and that could be because she just wont let him show any interest in them .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: so has he ever done I saw he was youknow putting some of the stuff on the doll has he done stuff like that ?
*MOT: he does it mostly to himself like uh hes hes gotten to the point where he wants to try to put his own clothes on and put his own socks on .
*MOT: so thats uh so it wasnt unusual that he was trying to put the socks on on the doll or the shoes on the doll so .
*EXP: is there anything that maybe he usually plays with at home that we didnt have here today ?
*MOT: um not particularly .
*MOT: we we have um youknow li I guess more intera like we have a trampoline at home and youknow more the stuff that he he does where which we we try to wear him out as you can as you can you may have guessed .
*MOT: we just try to wear him out so his things are more um youknow manuvera .
*MOT: which may be also why he was up down in the chairs and up down in that because thats just thats generally how he plays at home .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: no sweetie .
*MOT: leave that alone .
*MOT: Colin .
*MOT: Colin .
*MOT: Colin .
*MOT: no we dont wanna mix up the toys .
*MOT: thankyou sweetie .
*MOT: but no youre not gonna go in there .
*MOT: food .
*MOT: never fail .
*MOT: never fails .
*EXP: does he like to use like the kitchen stuff ?
*MOT: not really .
*MOT: he only is interested in the kitchen if Im in it .
*MOT: because it usually means that food is coming .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: its not so much the kitchen uh not really kitchen items .
*MOT: um no not even at home .
*MOT: no hes never been like a kid that bangs on the pots or anything like that .
*EXP: did you um I guess did you notice anything else today that was unusual or ?
*MOT: hm .
*EXP: pretty typical or .
*MOT: its pretty typical of his behavior yeah not really uh .
*MOT: yeah no .
*MOT: Imean I I g hes pretty s Im pretty sure as soon as I put him in the car hes gonna collapse over because I he is sleepy Im pretty sure of that .
*MOT: um but uh for the most part he hes its youknow his behavior isnt out of sorts or out of .
*MOT: hes hes a very active two year old with an attention span like that .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: alright .
