*EXP: do you mind if I ask you a few questions ?
*MOT: sure .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um did you see any xxx or did you notice anything different from last time ?
*MOT: um not so much .
*MOT: Imean I think he he kind of .
*MOT: well he I think he maybe selfdirected himself a little more .
*MOT: in terms of he kind of moved through the toys more on his own I guess .
*MOT: um and youknow I tried to let him do that to see what he was interested in .
*MOT: sorry xxx .
*MOT: uh but not not a heck of a lot of difference .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um the toys that he chose to play with this time .
*MOT: well he I think he likes more of those toys .
*MOT: hes hes hes sort of somewhat interested in everything .
*MOT: he was less interested I think in the books this time .
*MOT: last time I think I tried to read him a book and this time I didnt .
*MOT: he didnt seem very into it .
*MOT: Imean I sort of did .
*MOT: but he didnt seem into it at all .
*MOT: um he seemed actually kind of interested in this thing for for more than before .
*MOT: Im not really sure why .
*MOT: um and youknow he seemed somewhat interested in the animals .
*MOT: but I think those toys are a little more interesting to him in in general .
*EXP: do you think he recognized the clock from home ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: I dont think I think he wants to teeth on it actually .
*MOT: I think its the texture .
*MOT: at first I thought he was trying to play peekaboo .
*MOT: hes been doing that a lot lately .
*MOT: like on the changing table he might pull up his onesie over his head and do peekaboo .
*MOT: um but he likes things obviously like that that are that make a little bit of noise .
*MOT: and he is teething so .
*MOT: um Imean hes been he was last time too .
*MOT: he has a lot of teeth .
*MOT: and so I think hes looking also for a certain texture sometimes .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: do you think he recognized the word clock ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: how about any of the other toys this time ?
*EXP: do you think he recognized any of their names ?
*MOT: uh youknow I dont think so really .
*MOT: because um yeah like we dont have like a fox at home .
*MOT: um uh I dont know .
*MOT: honestly these are really difficult .
*MOT: book maybe .
*MOT: but um doggie maybe .
*MOT: but Im not sure .
*MOT: because like my my other son has a ton of stuffed animals .
*MOT: but none of them look like that .
*MOT: so I dont know if he recog .
*MOT: do you know what I mean ?
*MOT: like if he really recognizes the words .
*MOT: Im not sure .
*MOT: I feel like he doesnt recognize a lot of words yet .
*MOT: but I think he understands like intonation and and meaning more so .
*MOT: like youknow when when youre like dont touch that kind of thing versus like youknow trying to be more like happy about something .
*MOT: I think he understands that much more than than the words themselves .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: that makes sense .
*EXP: um any foods um that he might ?
*MOT: well the peas that he eats are a little more pureed than that .
*MOT: so I dont know .
*MOT: Imean and weve started to obviously because he has um youknow good swallowing and chewing .
*MOT: Ive been trying to do some like mashed peas for him without the skin .
*MOT: um he might recognize them .
*MOT: but Im not really sure .
*MOT: the waffle he has some wheat free ones that he has occasionally .
*MOT: so he might recognize that .
*MOT: but theyre round not square .
*MOT: so I dont know .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and how about at home ?
*EXP: any changes in the toys that hes playing hes been playing with at home ?
*MOT: you know not really .
*MOT: the funny thing is actually like I feel like here maybe its because theres its quieter and less distractions but like he sat and played with all the toys .
*MOT: and at home I feel like if you try to get him interested in something hell wanna go and like play with the dogs toys or go and like youknow uh pull up the plants or something like that .
*MOT: like hes much more into doing something else other than like kind of sitting here and playing with the different toys in a way even when you try to do that with him .
*MOT: its kind of funny .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: I dont know .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um how about any activities that you played .
*EXP: I know you had um .
*MOT: that we do at home versus here ?
*EXP: well yeah or maybe that you did do here .
*EXP: either one .
*EXP: it doesnt hafta be different than what you did here .
*MOT: well we do similar things at at home .
*MOT: like we might play with certain types of toys or um try and read a book or play with like stuffed animals or things like that .
*MOT: so Imean its somewhat the same .
*MOT: Imean a a lot of times like I say I think hes more active at home .
*MOT: like he likes to be walking around holding onto your hands xxx and that type of um uh activity .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: I think thats um .
*EXP: oh maybe what what do you think he was most interested in ?
*MOT: um I think those spoons at the end there actually .
*MOT: that he was interested in that pitcher for a little bit and the spoons .
*MOT: I think he liked trying to stick them stick them in his mouth .
*MOT: and I think he liked the sound that they made and the fact that there was more than one of them .
*MOT: um but yeah I think .
*MOT: and a little bit with the the bee like when it bounced .
*MOT: he smiled when I did that a little bit .
*MOT: um so .
*MOT: but I think for himself I think the the spoons .
*EXP: do you find youre using um like a lot of sound effects at home when you like use animals and things because thats what he he likes sound effects ?
*MOT: um Im not sure if I u uh .
*MOT: I dont know if I u .
*MOT: Imean I guess I do to some extent .
*MOT: youknow .
*MOT: its kinda fun watching him like trying to figure these things out and that kind of stuff .
*MOT: um yeah Imean I think he I think he likes I think he likes being surprised sometimes .
*MOT: like he loves playing peekaboo .
*MOT: sometimes like you can really get him laughing .
*MOT: and um he has this clacker toy that its its a musical thing that he thinks its hysterical .
*MOT: I dont know why .
*MOT: youknow like .
*MOT: but thats like one of the few things he responds to like that .
*MOT: so I guess he does like .
*MOT: he likes getting like youknow raspberries on his on his skin and stuff like that .
*MOT: he likes um youknow uh being sort of like held up and down kind of thing .
*MOT: so Imean he um uh I think he he sort of likes a diversity of activities I guess .
*MOT: hey .
*MOT: and at one point I could tell he was trying to make a poop .
*MOT: thats okay .
*EXP: uh so you think this time he he probably preferred the books least ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: Id say least this time .
*MOT: yeah definitely .
*EXP: seems to be liking that pile over there .
*MOT: yeah today he really seemed into it .
*MOT: he also yeah hes into throwing stuff too so .
*MOT: and Im not sure if hes doing it for the this part of it or to hear them like as they youknow kind of crash together kind of thing .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: alright .
*EXP: thank you very much for coming in .
*EXP: we always appreciate it .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: okay no problem .
*MOT: xxx model baby behavior .
