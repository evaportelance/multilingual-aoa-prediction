*EXP: um so what do you think um she liked to play with today ?
*MOT: the doll and the keys have been her fascination today .
*MOT: what ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: how was she playing with them ?
*EXP: how were you engaging her to play ?
*MOT: um the doll Im not sure she was getting .
*MOT: the doll was confusing .
*MOT: she kinda wanted to play with it but seemed frustrated with it .
*MOT: um so just kinda talking to her about what she had .
*MOT: um ofcourse everything that goes to the mouth .
*MOT: so the keys were great because its teething time so any toy that goes to the mouth is a fabulous toy .
*MOT: yes ?
*MOT: oh now you found the mic .
*MOT: I was waiting for that .
*MOT: um trying to show her just a couple different things .
*MOT: um just so so she saw what was around .
*MOT: but she tended to go back to those few .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: xxx different one ?
*MOT: mostly the doll the key .
*MOT: a little bit of the food .
*MOT: right ?
*EXP: um would you think she picked out particular um like colors of keys or do you think it would ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: I think it just she found what it was the blue one and I guess just something grabbed her eye on that one .
*MOT: but I dont think it was color related .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: I dont .
*MOT: because we didnt realize there were other ones till the last couple minutes .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: right ?
*EXP: you said that she played with some of the food items ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: were there some that you think that shes beginning to recognize the names of or do you think she was attracted to some items that have the colors ?
*MOT: hm I dont think it was recognition of food from home .
*MOT: would it be the colors ?
*MOT: or just I would say vicinity but its not vicinity because she can get around .
*MOT: I dunno if its the shape ?
*MOT: to fit in your hand well ?
*MOT: what would we say ?
*MOT: you know it tended to be the brighter colors so maybe it is c maybe colors .
*MOT: youre making me work here .
*MOT: think about this .
*EXP: Im sorry .
*MOT: no its okay its fine .
*EXP: um do you have pretend food at home ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: and she doesnt have a big doll like that so I was thinking oh I might hafta go get a doll for her because shes got two brothers at home older brothers so most of the toys are not what most people would say girly toys .
*MOT: um so there is one babydoll in the house but I dont think its even out where she would be able to find it and play with it .
*MOT: so it made me think I might needta go get her something like that because she seemed to gravitate right towards that one .
*MOT: but no .
*MOT: no food .
*MOT: thats not true .
*MOT: we do have fake food but not like kid food .
*MOT: we have fake like um fruit .
*MOT: big size regular fruit food but .
*MOT: they dont know about that .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: so she probably um doesnt you were saying that she probably doesnt recognize any of those foods from the foods at ho .
*EXP: or the names of it .
*EXP: or even the look I guess .
*MOT: probably not .
*MOT: Imean do we have pizza at home ?
*MOT: yes we eat pizza but shes not exposed to it .
*MOT: um a plate maybe .
*MOT: but again youre not using plates .
*MOT: well youre using a bowl but its not that not that close to you .
*MOT: so I dont I dont think its recognition yet I dont think its familiar .
*EXP: probably more like the shape and texture maybe of the jars ?
*EXP: like put them together or .
*MOT: no the jars might be more similar just like just of the toys the shape at home .
*MOT: and it fits in her mouth so .
*MOT: yeah is that funny ?
*MOT: xxx silly .
*MOT: because what do you play with at home ?
*MOT: you play with you play with a lot of big kid toys .
*MOT: I know .
*MOT: you play with she plays with a lot of cars .
*MOT: she plays with .
*MOT: she plays with her brothers cars .
*MOT: um right ?
*MOT: its mostly actually the boys stuff upstairs not yours .
*MOT: so it is yours .
*MOT: um oh I know .
*MOT: Im sorry I wiped your noise .
*MOT: not nice .
*MOT: not nice thing to do Mom .
*EXP: how about um did you play with any of the stuffed animals ?
*MOT: I tried to play a little bit with the WordWorld ones but she was not into it .
*MOT: she wanted to go back the keys or the doll .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: a couple times I tried to change them to the the stuffed animals or the book and she just didnt want those .
*MOT: wasnt interested in those today .
*EXP: Im sorry you said she has stuffed animals at home ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: I I was just trying to bring them in today to change her um the toys she was playing with just to kinda show her other things .
*MOT: so we did I grabbed these and I grabbed this one .
*MOT: and then I grabbed a book and wasnt too in into those too much .
*MOT: now we do the stuffed animals that he will play with smaller things like this .
*MOT: not this one but like a little stuffed animal .
*EXP: have you begun to like introduce their names ?
*EXP: do you think that she recognizes what some of the animals would be if you produced them ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: no ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: absolutely not .
*MOT: um one because like I said she doesnt really play with them and I just I dont shes gotten the concept .
*MOT: I think shes starting to recognize maybe when we talk about like sitting down to eat .
*MOT: and I think she recognizes when we talk about like the family .
*MOT: a little bit .
*MOT: um but I dont think shes at that at that point yet .
*MOT: and maybe Im underestimating you but I dont think you do .
*MOT: I dont .
*MOT: I dont .
*EXP: so you you said you guys um looked at some books ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: do you have some of these books at home ?
*MOT: we have PutMeInTheZoo .
*MOT: we have TheFootBook but we have them in the bigger versions .
*MOT: um shes never seen this one .
*MOT: but we do .
*MOT: we read books .
*MOT: and a lot of times the bo with her brothers and shell sit there with us xxx .
*MOT: she will grab books sometimes and just kinda play with the pages .
*MOT: so she is familiar with books .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: so I would say you kinda recognize a book because we play with those .
*MOT: right ?
*EXP: is she interested in the xxx touch and feel ?
*MOT: not at all .
*EXP: really ?
*MOT: not at all .
*MOT: that was wa the keys really Imean these were fascinating her .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: you just like those .
*MOT: thats what exactly why .
*MOT: what ?
*MOT: and maybe if I had shown her the book when she wasnt fascinated with the other toy .
*MOT: instead of trying to change her fo to or her focus .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: you had no interest in this book .
*MOT: and now youre gonna be interested in eating .
*MOT: not today .
*EXP: how about any none of the books ?
*MOT: no she didnt seem to wanna read this one either .
*MOT: or listen .
*EXP: do you play pattycake and games like that or interact with her ?
*MOT: well do .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: sometimes we do we do some .
*MOT: we will do um ItsyBitsySpider .
*MOT: we will do abcs with sign language .
*MOT: um we do open shut them .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: no no pattycake really .
*MOT: not so much xxx pattycake .
*MOT: but well sing the song open shut them and do the hands with it yes .
*MOT: and then we do abcs and we do sign language so you can follow the hands with that .
*MOT: um other hand plays no .
*MOT: we do little rhyming songs and .
*MOT: oh excuse you .
*MOT: we do well go lets see which one .
*MOT: ride a horsie into town .
*MOT: just be careful you dont fall down .
*MOT: and thats one we like to do .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: and then and our and our brothers usually get involved too .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: ride a horsie into town .
*MOT: just be careful you dont fall down .
*MOT: so some of that kind of repetitive play .
*MOT: or songs .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: do you think she rec thought uh the doll was another baby when interacting with it ?
*EXP: like xxx actions and motions like it was ?
*MOT: I was I wasnt sure .
*MOT: I thought maybe .
*MOT: and thats why I wasnt sure if thats why she was getting frustrated .
*MOT: because it wasnt really responding to her .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so I didnt know if it was something like youknow its kinda of her size and maybe it looked familiar .
*MOT: and like she would smile at it and then shed kinda go like grunt would sound is frustrating .
*MOT: so I didnt know if she like thought it was something that should be playing with her .
*MOT: versus her playing with it just Soley .
*MOT: what is that over there ?
*MOT: what is this thing ?
*MOT: and so yeah I was trying to figure out what what was going through her head .
*MOT: because it was like I want you but then it was like .
*MOT: youre not doing what I want you to do whatever it was that she wanted .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: what is that ?
*MOT: what is this ?
*MOT: Imean she definitely was doing what she does to us .
*MOT: she pokes at her eyes she pulls at the hair .
*MOT: she grabs hair .
*MOT: so like that grunt .
*MOT: its its like shes frustrated .
*MOT: so I dunno if she expects it to respond differently .
*EXP: did you guys play with any of the articles of clothing or um I dunno .
*MOT: we took off a shoe .
*MOT: or I took off the shoe .
*MOT: but she had no interest in that .
*MOT: she seemed to notice a bandaid but .
*EXP: shes really upset with it .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: shes like come play with me .
*MOT: come do something .
*MOT: what is it you want it to do ?
*MOT: do you want her to sing talk back to you ?
*MOT: stand up like you do ?
*MOT: lets see I dont I think shes sposta do something different .
*MOT: is it like a little baby girl ?
*MOT: give you kisses ?
*EXP: does she give kisses and hugs and ?
*MOT: shell just give her hugs her squeezes .
*MOT: youknow she wont xxx .
*MOT: but no kisses .
*MOT: youre not a kissykiss yet .
*MOT: thats not true .
*MOT: well lean her over and shell just like open her mouth and drool on you .
*MOT: to give you a kiss .
*MOT: and youknow her brothers really love that one .
*MOT: so she will .
*MOT: well like kinda lean her in for goodnight kisses .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: and as we talk Im gonna nurse her so I hope you dont mind .
*EXP: no not at all .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: um do you think xxx texture xxx um ?
*EXP: sounds ?
*MOT: um color maybe .
*MOT: sound there were no real sounds in todays toys .
*MOT: it does get her attention some at home some of the noises .
*MOT: um wow .
*MOT: what is it that attracts you to these toys ?
*EXP: Imean we could talk about like the difference between some of .
*EXP: like the plastic food is harder um than the stuffed animals .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: texture .
*EXP: so anything that you xxx comparison of these toys ?
*MOT: Imean the food and I guess the key were .
*MOT: Imean these were kind of hard and soft .
*MOT: kinda squeezy .
*MOT: good for teething .
*MOT: and so maybe things that are just good to chew on .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: Imean she probably likes that harder stuff when it all goes to the mouth .
*MOT: um they were the right size for her to pick up .
*MOT: so to be able to grasp and hold and play with they were a good size .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and how xxx you said at home she plays with cars and things like that does she play similar to how she how she plays at home in some ways ?
*MOT: um it actually felt different .
*MOT: and I think its one because theres such a variety right here .
*MOT: and there were no other distractions which is not very typical at home .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um so I was actually surprised that she wasnt more mobile .
*MOT: I wa I thought she was gonna kinda go around and check out other s the chairs .
*MOT: or move around to other toys than actually sit fairly fairly still here .
*MOT: so that kinda surprised me .
*EXP: that she was actually engaged in the toys ?
*MOT: well not just even Imean that she just wanted stayed in this one vicinity .
*MOT: and I thought she might explore a little bit more or take a toy over somewhere move about them more xxx because theres so many .
*MOT: and it was all right in front of her so she didnt hafta go far .
*MOT: if there were because there were no other real distractions .
*MOT: which youknow like I said usually at home its her brothers .
*MOT: or were I guess not sitting with her for fifteen straight minutes at a time .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um which sounds bad as I say that but reality is youknow it just doesnt happen as much at home .
*MOT: so it was it was interesting to watch her just kinda sit here .
*MOT: and play with just a couple .
*MOT: and stay in a fairly small area .
*EXP: does she play with each toy the same way as she would at .
*EXP: does she explore them the same way or did you find yourself since it was new kind of um prompting her differently or youknow .
*MOT: no that Imean the way she played seemed fairly simi familiar or similar that the way we do at home .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: youknow we talk about what shes playing with .
*MOT: and then sometimes we just let her kinda go with youknow without the prompts or without the the talking .
*MOT: the narrative to it .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: youknow we try to kind of youknow go over oh its the pizza or oh youve got blue key .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um and then sometimes its just xxx play quietly or for a few minutes just kinda let her do what she was doing .
*MOT: so its not forced .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: kind of let her play on her own ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: was there anything um any of the items here that you think .
*EXP: I know I keep asking you in different ways the same question .
*MOT: its okay .
*EXP: that you think um she was familiar with or even new kind of some new items that ?
*MOT: well stuffed animals I would say is pretty new .
*MOT: Im what did I say the b .
*MOT: sorry the babydoll .
*MOT: not the stuffed animals .
*MOT: books familiar .
*MOT: um food new .
*MOT: Im just trying to think of if it would be similar to even though we dont have food but the shape to another toy at home .
*MOT: no I think theyre pretty theyre pretty novel for what we have .
*MOT: um trying to think of the toys that have been upstairs that shes been playing with a lot .
*MOT: because we have a lot of blocks like square soft blocks that she plays with .
*MOT: rattles .
*MOT: um what else do you like to play with ?
*MOT: youre at your table top toy more .
*MOT: so thats youknow stationary .
*MOT: um a lot of novelty for her .
*MOT: the stuffed animals even at home she doesnt play with too much .
*MOT: Imean theyre there .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but its not one of her go to toys .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: okay so like everything could have been potentially well not everything but a lot of it could have been potentially new .
*MOT: unique and kind of .
*EXP: yeah and like new like words like in i like presenting them in isolation .
*EXP: this is a that kind of thing .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: that funny ?
*MOT: yeah were talking about you .
*MOT: yeah these are yeah .
*MOT: i a lot of its probably new vocabulary when we talk about it other than colors .
*MOT: colors well talk about um .
*MOT: but a lot of it would be new new words .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: what are you doing ?
*EXP: is there anything else that we didnt talk about that you played with today ?
*MOT: um I dont think so .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: no ?
*MOT: no ?
*MOT: no because we tried to play with the books but she didnt .
*MOT: I Imean I thought that the stuffed animals were gonna catch her attention more .
*MOT: just the colors and just .
*MOT: but they caught my attention .
*MOT: I like them .
*MOT: no thats not xxx .
*MOT: what do you think ?
*MOT: no ?
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: um like I said the doll .
*MOT: made me think Im gonna hafta go get the doll from downstairs and let her play with it a little bit more .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: oh youre so happy now .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so much better .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: well I think that thats it for today then .
