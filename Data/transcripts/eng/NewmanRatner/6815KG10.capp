*EXP: okay Im gonna start asking you some questions .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: I have a few questions for you .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: so um do you remember what she liked last time and has it changed ?
*MOT: I think she focused on the food a lot last time and shes focusing on the food this time too .
*EXP: anything in particular ?
*MOT: food items ?
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: she likes this meat .
*MOT: and I dont why because its not very colorful .
*MOT: maybe it looks really like its real so she shes kind of eating some real table food so she might be more appe it might be more appealing than some of the stuff that doesnt look as real .
*EXP: maybe it hasta do with the texture ?
*MOT: maybe .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: little bumpy .
*MOT: and shes teething it could be soothing her .
*MOT: but shes not sucking on it really for her gums so Im not sure what she why she likes that .
*MOT: she te she was g she liked the doll at first and she does seem to like babydolls when we see them in the store and what not .
*MOT: shes just very nurturing already .
*MOT: she likes to feed things .
*MOT: thats about all she .
*MOT: she could be just hungry but she just seems like thats her focus is to feed it whatever it is .
*MOT: she was feeding the dogs .
*MOT: but she wasnt as interested in the stuffed toys .
*MOT: I think last time she did play with them a little bit .
*MOT: she was really not interested this time .
*MOT: especially not unless they were the two little dogs .
*MOT: if it was Pooh she looked she didnt wanna even look at Pooh .
*MOT: um she likes the spoons .
*MOT: I dont know what her fascination is with spoons shes that way at home too .
*MOT: and she didnt really give me much attention on the books .
*MOT: normally she likes books .
*MOT: so I cant say shes necessarily going for the things with lots of color .
*MOT: she seems a little interested in this bottle .
*MOT: and shes not nearly as talkative as she normally would be but maybe thats because theres so many things in front of her .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: whats that ?
*EXP: what did you find ?
*MOT: spaghetti .
*MOT: yum you had spaghetti last night for dinner .
*EXP: I was gonna ask you do you think she recognizes any of the food items or anything ?
*MOT: um maybe the icecream .
*MOT: this might have been interesting because of the colors Im not sure .
*MOT: it looks interesting .
*MOT: and she does shes not really eating icecream so Im not sure if shes relating the two .
*MOT: she could be looking at that spaghetti and thinking it looks similar .
*MOT: she ate the noodles last night .
*MOT: she likes keys .
*MOT: she didnt play with it as long as I thought she would .
*MOT: but she did at least look at it and kind of hold it and twist it around a little bit .
*MOT: and she really I think her favorite thing was these peas .
*MOT: so I dunno if its the texture the color she eats a lot of peas so .
*MOT: she could think theyre real .
*EXP: are her peas that she eats are they like mushed up or are they ?
*MOT: nope .
*MOT: she did eat mushed peas but now shes eating regular peas .
*MOT: she likes peas and carrots thats her favorite food .
*MOT: so she could have thought those were real .
*EXP: yeah definitely .
*MOT: yep .
*MOT: thats about .
*MOT: but she seemed annoyed when I kept trying to show her the stuffed animals .
*MOT: I want food .
*MOT: I wanna eat .
*MOT: look Kennipoo .
*MOT: you gonna feed them peanutbutt .
*MOT: oh you like this one ?
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: yeah you like his shiny hat .
*MOT: you gonna feed him some dinner ?
*MOT: Im hungry Kennedy .
*MOT: can you please give me some cookie ?
*MOT: please ?
*MOT: Kennedy .
*MOT: excuse me .
*MOT: can I please have a cookie ?

*MOT: no .
*MOT: I dont have any of these .
*MOT: I have one like that with the touching with the different textures .
*MOT: and we do read a lot of DoctorSeuss theyre just not small like this .
*MOT: but I have baby books for her .
*MOT: that size .
*EXP: um what else was I going to ask ?
*EXP: do you have lots of toys at home that make a lot of noise or whats her thing ?
*EXP: does she like toys that make noise or ?
*EXP: like is it more babies or is it more reading ?
*MOT: she likes noisy toys .
*MOT: the stuff that she can bang on and it would like shes got the little piano thing where you stand up and walk around it and it has different sections on there where it makes different sounds .
*MOT: and then shes got a we got it for Christmas a microphone toy .
*MOT: so she likes to turn the microphone all the way high .
*MOT: and then yell in it .
*EXP: nice .
*MOT: and stick it in her mouth and yell .
*MOT: so thats probably her favorite thing to do with them with her toys .
*MOT: um and she likes babydolls .
*MOT: she likes the ones that move .
*MOT: youknow with batteries or something but .
*MOT: those are probab .
*MOT: stuff that lights up .
*MOT: probably is the most interesting to her .
*MOT: and she likes to watch movies like intently .
*MOT: she doesnt even take her gaze off the movie its weird .
*MOT: because we have movies in the car and she just the whole time shes watching the movie doesnt like to be interrupted .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: you can take her to a movie theater earlier than most kids .
*MOT: probably I could .
*MOT: I havent really tried that .
*MOT: my husband took her and said she was fine .
*MOT: but in the car she watches movies all day all the time .
*MOT: in the car .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: um do you play games with her like uh pattycake or anything like that ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: what other types of games do you play with her ?
*MOT: um peekaboo pattycake Ill hide stuff behind my back or under something and see if she can find it .
*MOT: um she wants she likes to crawl down the hall and I come and chase her and grab her and say come back Kennipoo and shell laugh hard super hard .
*MOT: she thinks thats the funniest thing in the world .
*MOT: so I guess the chase well Ill chase her down the hall .
*MOT: um she likes to think shes gonna get away with something .
*MOT: god bless you .
*MOT: god bless you baby .
*MOT: so shell take something and um that she knows she shouldnt have like a pen or something .
*MOT: and shell look at me and then shell try to run with it .
*MOT: because she knows she shouldnt have it .
*MOT: and she laughs really hard when Im trying to get it from her so she thinks thats so funny .
*EXP: oh thats funny .
*EXP: shes testing you already .
*MOT: mhm mhm .
*EXP: is that your favorite ?
*EXP: I think it is .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: like why are they not coming apart ?
*EXP: I think that they do look the most real maybe out of all the foods .
*MOT: probably .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: do you have any food items at home ?
*MOT: mhm we have a full kitchen in our play room .
*MOT: she doesnt really play with that food though maybe shes not interested yet .
*MOT: or its in her house so shes not .
*MOT: but she um .
*MOT: and actually she doesnt really like the play room that much which is strange because its all primary colors and theres a big soft mat to walk around on and do stuff .
*MOT: but Ive brought her down there a few times and she just .
*MOT: maybe shes overwhelmed Imean theres a lot of toys I have a lot of children .
*EXP: oh yeah ?

*MOT: she seems just like shes right where she should be .
*MOT: shes doing fine .
*MOT: and shes got older siblings .
*MOT: a three year old a five year old and a seven year old .
*MOT: so shes probably gonna be a little advanced in terms of trying to learn to talk sooner .
*MOT: I think my three year old Ive never seen any child talk as as well as she did and as quickly as she did .
*MOT: she was saying full sentences at eleven months .
*EXP: wow .
*MOT: shes not there .
*MOT: she still babbles .
