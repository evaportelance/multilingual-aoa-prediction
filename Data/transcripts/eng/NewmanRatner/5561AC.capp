*EXP: alright .
*EXP: xxx um and Ill just ask you a few questions .
*MOT: of course .
*EXP: just kinda like weve done the past you know three or four times youve been here .
*EXP: um so if you just wanna kinda start just kinda tell me what she starting playing with .
*MOT: um well the animals because we collect I mean she wasnt speaking for a little while and so what someone told me was they do the animal sounds so we started collecting and doing the animal sounds .
*MOT: so she has a lot of these characters .
*MOT: um so I think those are familiar to her .
*MOT: and she has started recently to reach the point where she will do like imaginative play she has a kitchen and her baby dolls and shell pretend like she is cooking dinner and go take care of the babies and stuff like that .
*MOT: so she likes a lot of this stuff now .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um I did notice I could hear a little bit making the animal sounds so is that something youve kinda been working on with her ?
*MOT: yeah because at a year she wasnt saying a lot of words so what um we had gotten referred to get evaluated I cant remember the name of it infant and childrenss I guess they came and evaluated and so they think everything is okay but a way to get her really talking is I guess kids start with the animal sounds .
*MOT: so every time we went to target we would get another one of the animals and so we have a huge collection of these .
*EXP: so does she know most of the sounds those animals make ?
*MOT: most of them like all the ones we have at home she .
*CHI: mommy .
*MOT: yes baby ?
*MOT: youre cooking ?
*MOT: very good .
*MOT: um all of the ones we have at home she knows the sound and name of it .
*MOT: um so those I think were familiar and like I said this now is like we bought her a little kitchen and little table and chair set so now shell play with those .
*EXP: were there any animals that she had never seen before ?
*MOT: yeah I mean a handful like the turkey and the peacock um there are a whole bunch in here that we dont have because theyre not the same collection .
*MOT: but like the ducks you know the ducks the birds the cats she knew um but I think some of the more like exotic animals we didnt have .
*EXP: mhm okay .
*EXP: so you said she played with the food a little bit um did she have a favorite food item you think ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: um xxx she kept giving me the juice to drink and pretend with her I mean she recognized the icecream right away which is a lot about what we feed her .
*MOT: um the icecream and her apple as she calls it .
*MOT: I think those are the ones that she recognizes the most .
*EXP: were there any that um maybe she would have never seen before ?
*MOT: um I cant even remember what these are called now not cranberries the I guess cranberries right thats the canned cranberries ?
*MOT: so some of these we you know the cheese shes done no pies um .
*MOT: what else do you have ?
*MOT: maybe the cupcakes I dunno if she recognizes cupcakes yet .
*MOT: but like the drinks whoops .
*EXP: um so does she have similar foods at home ?
*MOT: to play with ?
*MOT: um you know honestly I dont have any of the foods yet I just have pots and pans I still needta pick up some of the foods for her .
*EXP: okay does she like to cook ?
*MOT: she pretends to cook and sometimes she will take whats in her bowl and put it in her pots and pans .
*MOT: you know like if Ive made some popcorn shell put the popcorn in their and play with it like shes cooking stirring it up .
*EXP: and then I guess any of these foods that um she would actually eat in real like I mean I know you said .
*MOT: oh yeah definitely the cheeses she eats um like lets see the cheeses the apples not the pies like shell do the pizza .
*MOT: um maybe icecream once in a while .
*MOT: I dont know what else we have here .
*MOT: some of the veggies if I am creative on how to give them to her .
*MOT: juice for sure .
*EXP: um so what did anything today that you tried to get her to play with that she wasnt really interested in ?
*MOT: I thought she was gonna go for the dolls she didnt go for the babies .
*MOT: she told me I mean she whispered them to me about the babies but she didnt wanna pick them up after I told her to go get them .
*EXP: so you said she plays with babies at home ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: okay what kinda stuff does she do with them usually ?
*MOT: shell feed them shell dress them you know shell push them in her stroller shell tell me that shes putting them nightnight .
*MOT: she will discipline them tell them you know no no and theyve been naughty .
*MOT: um so I mean everything she sees done shell do I mean Ive seen her rocking the babies to sleep .
*EXP: um anything you noticed today about her play that was different from what you normally see ?
*MOT: I mean today I mean today shes just being very shy .
*MOT: I mean shes usually loud and wild and this is not .
*MOT: and I dont know like I said she didnt get a nap and the sitters she fell asleep in the car she got a twenty minute nap and I woke her up .
*MOT: so I dont know if thats part of it and then part of it too I think everythings just unfamiliar .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: um so are there any things at home that she plays with a lot that we dont have here ?
*MOT: um we play with legos .
*MOT: lets see she actually her dad has an ipad and shell play theres like animal games where you hit the card and animal will make a sound or theres matching games on there that shell play like I mean like she can navigate her way through the different games on the ipad .
*EXP: yeah there kids are amazing like that these days .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: um I mean I dont we dont let her play a lot with it but she can do that .
*MOT: so the legos the dolls the only toys I have out for her are the legos the animals and then her kitchen and doll set are the only toys we have out .
*MOT: and then shes got like a basketball hoop and you know basketball and soccer ball .
*MOT: um we just bought a dollhouse but I havent even put it together yet for her .
*MOT: so I dont have I try not to have too too many toys out for her because they end up everywhere .
*EXP: right yeah .
*EXP: they can be a little over stimulating and .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: alright well she did a great job today .
*EXP: she was uh I know she seemed just a little tired but she was great .
*EXP: shes probably not feeling too great .
*MOT: yeah shes not I mean this is she was stuffy but now its all runny this is new .
*EXP: oh I have the trash over here so .
*MOT: let me see let me see let me see Im sorry .
*EXP: um alright so we can um just give you we have two more consent forms for you to sign .
*EXP: xxx another visit just to wrap everything up .
*MOT: how soon did you need because next so my schedule really because I guess it hasta be me it cant be her dad because they said since Im the one thats been bringing her ?
*EXP: what do we needta do now xxx .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: I think for that it would be okay we needed you definitely for the play session but um I think it would be alright if we did those .
*EXP: what are you looking for ?
*EXP: um yeah I think that should be fine .
*EXP: weve had a couple of sessions that like dont finish the last one or two things and I dont think it really matters because youre not doing too much with that like shell just be naming pictures or repeating what we say .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: so I mean yeah really it would be okay um in that case um .
*EXP: so kinda what Ill explain to you now is why we do why weve needed you kinda throughout .
*EXP: so um as weve been listening to her speech throughout the whole study but um weve also been recording your speech especially during the play session .
*EXP: um and this first consent form is just kinda explaining how weve already recorded your speech um and if you agree to participate in this portion of the research we would go back and analyze these recordings and look for things such as speaking rate variety of words length of sentences how carefully you are producing your words and other things like that .
*EXP: um so we do this for both your speech and your childs speech .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: um and so this first consent form is just giving us permission to analyze your speech when you talk to her and um so that kinda why we needta do throughout .
*EXP: um and then the second consent form um .
*EXP: this is another aspect that um we are looking for is there is currently an online database of parent and childrens speech um but its a little outdated so they are doing this whole update with it .
*EXP: um and this portion is entirely voluntary um but it allows us um to provide um your both yours and your childs data to other language researchers and other universities .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: um so this kinda comes with three options that you are free to pick you know whichever one you want .
*EXP: um so the first option is I do not want any of my data or my childs data to be made available to other language researchers so it would just be available to us here at university of Maryland .
*EXP: um the second option is allow anonymous transcripts and test score data to be made available to other language researchers so that would what we would do is we would take um both your speech and we would analyze it and do a written transcription of that and then that would be uploaded um .
