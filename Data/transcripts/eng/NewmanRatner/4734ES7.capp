*MOT: oh .
*EXP: the amount of toys ?
*MOT: she seemed to like these a lot .
*MOT: just the shaking and .
*EXP: think it was .
*MOT: just making sounds and stuff .
*MOT: I think I think its .
*EXP: are there any that you see that you think are good in particular for her type of personality the kind of kid that she is at this point ?
*MOT: I think she likes she likes things that she can manipulate a lot so thats why I didnt really go for these because I didnt think that shed be into .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: you know something to just look at and hold .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um although I think she liked feeling the textures a little bit .
*EXP: I see .
*MOT: but uh .
*EXP: but do you think ?
*MOT: but she she seems to be more interested in things that she can kind of manipulate .
*MOT: and ac actually at home she just likes to play with like pieces of paper and crumple them up and .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: um I know she likes to put things in her mouth a lot too but she yeah .
*MOT: she likes things that she can kind of do something with .
*EXP: uhhum .
*EXP: at your belly .
*EXP: so the toys that she could make a sound with do you feel like those were that type of a thing and she probably likes that for that reason ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I think she she seemed to be more interested in that .
*EXP: does she .
*MOT: she likes things that she can shake and .
*EXP: I was gonna say does she have any toys like that at home ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: yeah weve got little teethers and things .
*MOT: I think I left the one in the car that I that I brought with us but its like uh um a teether and its got little rings on it .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: and um so she can kind of shake them and she can feel them and move them move them around .
*EXP: the rings around and stuff .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: she likes that .
*EXP: I think I know what youre talking about theres .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: theyre making some really good things for babies these days .
*MOT: yeah this ones like a a butterfly and the wings are kinda crinkly .
*EXP: oh so they make a crackly sound ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: she likes that .
*MOT: she likes that .
*EXP: um did she see a book that she liked in particular in the book bin did you think ?
*MOT: um she didnt really seem to go for one in particular .
*MOT: I mean she I think she looked at that one with the ducks on the cover maybe .
*EXP: a little bit .
*MOT: a second or two longer so thats why I pulled that one out for her .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but .
*EXP: does she have a favorite book or books at home that you have that she likes she likes to look at with you ?
*MOT: not really .
*MOT: I have you know its really sad I have so little time to spend alone with her because uh because I have two two and a half year olds and uh .
*EXP: thats understandable .
*EXP: that is .
*EXP: I was just wondering if shes attached sometimes .
*MOT: she also still it seems like she likes um some of the cloth books we have that have also again squeakers and crinkly things and things that make noise .
*EXP: oops .
*EXP: around the side perhaps .
*EXP: Im not writing anything down Donna because were getting it on there so I dont hafta write .
*EXP: just attach it over here .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: thats right .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: oops .
*MOT: oh oh .
*MOT: you wanna check everything out .
*EXP: um so I was gonna say it sounds like she .
*MOT: you wanna check it all out ?
*EXP: prefers toys over books would you say thats .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: true ?
*MOT: um at this point yeah .
*MOT: I .
*EXP: see if shell look at the xxx .
*MOT: I dont know that Ive spent enough time reading to her that shes maybe hasnt been exposed to books that much .
*EXP: maybe uh one of the subsequent visits that will be more clear .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: you know well see how she changes over time .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: do you .
*MOT: its also funny for me I I know um usually when I play with her Im holding her like this .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: so its kinda funny for me to to have her in front of me and .
*EXP: exactly .
*MOT: it was a little bit unnatural for me but um .
*EXP: I see okay thats interesting to know .
*EXP: so if you did play with her shed be more like this ?
*MOT: a lot of times yeah I spend sitting with her like this .
*EXP: yeah mhm .
*MOT: and uh she often doesnt just doesnt like being put down .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so yeah I think .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: she likes .
*MOT: shes just in a in a really good mood right now and shes you know .
*EXP: she sure is .
*EXP: so she did fine with that .
*MOT: shes feeling pretty secure .
*MOT: yeah at home a lot of time she cries if shes put down on the floor because maybe she thinks Im gonna go run off and do something else .
*EXP: she likes to be close to you .
*MOT: yeah she does .
*EXP: um this is she might be too young I mean were just wondering if if shes interested in pretend food at all or um those kinds of things or dolls anything like that at home ?
*EXP: I mean you already told me that she really likes things she can manipulate so .
*MOT: she can .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: kinda like this .
*MOT: she can play with but she has a little um like uh its a Humpty Dumpty just like a little soft toy .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: its got a hole in the middle of it so she can kind of hold on to it and she seems to like that but yeah mostly she likes .
*EXP: you like action huh ?
*MOT: she likes action .
*EXP: you like to shake and make noise and see what will happen if you do this to that .
*EXP: is that what its about right now Ellie ?
*EXP: that sounds about right doesnt it ?
*MOT: shes got something its like a soft block and then um I think its got .
*EXP: uhoh .
*MOT: trying to remember .
*EXP: uhoh .
*MOT: its like its got a little bell inside so when she shakes it it it kinda jingles and then it its got different little textures on it and things .
*EXP: Ive seen some like that some of them have things on the sides like a mirror .
*MOT: yeah I think it has a mirror on it .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: and its got a little flap .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: it just has like a pattern on the outside and then when you lift the flap theres a picture of a bear underneath .
*EXP: so she sometimes likes that one ?
*MOT: she likes to play with that one .
*EXP: very cool .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: cool .
*EXP: okay well are there any sort of toy related um things that I didnt ask you that you think are are pertinent to what shes interested in at this point ?
*EXP: toys or objects or things ?
*MOT: I think she ends up um kind of crawling amongst her sisters toys a lot so she um .
*EXP: youre influenced huh ?
*MOT: yeah she is very influenced by the two year olds and um .
*MOT: you know so a lot of the like smaller plush toys and little teethers and things that I had when her sisters were infants um I just havent even really taken out for her because its just too much stuff .
*EXP: so shes happy enough crawling among their things right .
*MOT: yeah she is and they have a lot of like cars you know not not things that um you know have small pieces or anything like that .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: just things that .
*MOT: things that um .
*EXP: things you might not normally buy for a seven month old .
*EXP: but shes getting exposed to them anyway .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: well thats very good .
*EXP: okay well thats all I needed to ask you at this point .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: so we can .
*EXP: and you did such a great job Ellie .
*EXP: couldnt have asked for a better happier baby .
