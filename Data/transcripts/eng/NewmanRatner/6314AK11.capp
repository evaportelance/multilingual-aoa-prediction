*MOT: questions yes .
*MOT: thats good .
*EXP: shes all over the place um .
*MOT: she is .
*MOT: I know you guys always wanna know what do I think is her favorite .
*EXP: oh yes so what you think was her favorite ?
*MOT: thats a tough call probably the baby .
*MOT: and she always loves the food .
*MOT: I tell I think I tell you guys every time I think its just because we have so much of it at home its all over the place youknow because we have the kitchen with the older daughter and .
*MOT: so this kind of stuff is she sees it a lot its everywhere .
*MOT: not necessarily the exact same things but similar ones youknow ?
*MOT: plastic food .
*EXP: oh she sees plastic food a lot .
*MOT: plastic food yeah yeah yeah .
*MOT: yeah she plays with that like her sisters always trying to feed her plastic food you know what I mean make meals for her and that kinda stuff yeah .
*MOT: so she sees plastic food a lot .
*MOT: and in the past shes always loved the keys .
*MOT: so I said even to her right away look somebody has the keys apart this time because they usually theyre on a .
*MOT: and she loves the jingling the the noise they make .
*MOT: that and like these spoons .
*MOT: if the spoons were all connected she would have right away gone to those two .
*MOT: she didnt even touch these .
*MOT: because theyre all separated .
*MOT: I thought that was very interesting .
*MOT: because she loves anything that makes a noise that she can jangle like that .
*MOT: so she loves the keys and the spoons when theyre together and I noticed they were apart this time that was very interesting .
*MOT: I wonder if thats because theyre older just to see what they do with them .
*EXP: I dont know why that is .
*EXP: maybe some xxx did that .
*MOT: ha .
*MOT: yeah maybe .
*MOT: thats why I said maybe someone tore them apart .
*MOT: like you .
*MOT: like a destructor baby like you .
*MOT: yeah because they have been on a a ring in the past and theres the other one .
*MOT: so maybe it was just a fluke .
*MOT: maybe it wasnt sposta be on purpose .
*EXP: yeah I dont know .
*MOT: thats kinda funny .
*MOT: and heres all these little spoons usually are connected too .
*MOT: or at least they have been .
*EXP: now the food she saw plastic food do you think she recognizes does she see those real foods like does she see pizza .
*MOT: pizza she does yes .
*MOT: peas .
*MOT: she hates peas but she hasta eat them .
*MOT: she does love regular icecream .
*MOT: she kept picking up the jar of peanutbutter which I thought was interesting because shes never eaten peanutbutter .
*MOT: and I its not like I she would I dont youknow shes not even really around when Im making a peanut butter sandwich for her sister youknow ?
*MOT: so that she definitely doesnt um .
*MOT: the bottle and the juice both she tried to drink herself youknow ?
*MOT: with both right away .
*MOT: the pizza shes fascinated with them I dont know why .
*MOT: because we dont eat pizza with any of that stuff on it at our house .
*MOT: I dont know if its because it has a lot of the colors .
*EXP: do you think that she knows its pizza ?
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: I I wish I knew I dont know .
*MOT: she might but I just dont know .
*MOT: because she will eat pizza .
*MOT: she will xxx that .
*MOT: hi .
*MOT: she loved reading the books she likes the fuzzy book .
*MOT: she does like that .
*MOT: and she loved the baby Ive never its the first time shes ever leaned in and given it a kiss .
*MOT: that was the first time we had ever done that she gave .
*MOT: the baby a kiss .
*MOT: didnt you ?
*MOT: you gave the baby a kiss .
*MOT: and I asked the other girl I had asked the other girl before I came in I said do you want me to like try and get her to talk like in her bika bika words or do you want me to just not .
*MOT: youknow I dont want do you want me to not influence her ?
*MOT: and she said whatever I wanted to do is fine .
*MOT: because she talks like bika bika all the time and we have like bika conversations like bika bika oh bika bika bika bika .
*EXP: now what is she .
*MOT: youknow like its just a sound she makes .
*MOT: and so we just imitate it back to her all the time and so then we have these conversations in bika language I call them .
*EXP: oh and she starts .
*MOT: she started it yes it was all it was her starting it .
*EXP: and and .
*MOT: but see like Ill say bika to her and then shell go oh bika bika bika you know what I mean ?
*MOT: so I influenced her and started it here but she came up with the word herself I dont even know when a long time ago .
*EXP: and .
*MOT: bika bika and thats just kinda .
*EXP: what is that and it will refer to whatever youre doing ?
*MOT: anything exactly whatever youre doing at the time yep .
*EXP: cause I noticed you .
*MOT: anything in any situation yep .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: so now its just a word that she just uses .
*MOT: its just a madeup word she uses for anything yep .
*MOT: when she yeah to replace whatever she cant say yeah .
*MOT: because she really only says like momma dada baba and baby .
*EXP: yeah shes pretty talk talkative .
*MOT: baby .
*MOT: addressed to the child .

*CHI: baby .
*MOT: a baby .
*MOT: she hasnt ever like tried to tear the clothes off or dress them or undress them yet or anything like that .
*MOT: but she picks them up and carries them around youknow and theyre dragging by their feet and stuff like that she does .
*MOT: whenever like they have little high chairs her sister puts them in the high chairs and shell pull them out .
*MOT: she puts them in the stroller she pulls them out .
*MOT: youknow ?
*MOT: and shes fascinated by their hair a lot of time shes like .
*MOT: youknow pulling out their hair .
*MOT: I said thats because you dont have any .
*MOT: thats because you dont have any of your own .
*MOT: see were still playing with the food I dont I dont know why .
*EXP: and um the books were .
*MOT: youre klutzy .
*MOT: uh this one I know she likes .
*MOT: I think I did the same ones as last time because I know she likes them .
*MOT: and the peekaboo baby one .
*MOT: she because I knew they capture her attention .
*MOT: youknow like xxx xxx xxx read something like this she wouldnt have listened for that long .
*MOT: she would have for a couple minutes but she prefers the interactive stuff at this age .
*MOT: she would have youknow gotten up or hit me or thrown it or pulled it away from me or something .
*MOT: because shell sit like when I read her sister books at night shell shell sit for the first few minutes of it and then shes squirming or grabbing at it or wanting to put it in her mouth or youknow because its a a more advanced book youknow ?
*MOT: from what her sister would pick or something so .
*MOT: but shes sitting longer and longer youknow its getting a little bit better shell sit for a little more of it .
*MOT: and I know that gets better with age too .
*MOT: but these those two are so good because the feeling and then the peekaboo .

*MOT: it wasnt ours though we just it was just borrowed so we dont have that .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: we dont have that one .
*MOT: now the clock I didnt know if shed be interested or not just because of the feel of it foamy .
*MOT: she looked at it for a few minutes but then .
*MOT: yeah nothing there to capture her too much whereas her sister would have loved it shes interested in telling all of the time even though she has no concept of it .
*MOT: shes always like what time is it mommy ?
