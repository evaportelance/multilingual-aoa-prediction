*MOT: the food she really liked .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and I see that yeah she likes to put them in her mouth .
*EXP: do you think thats the reason or do you think theres some other reason that she likes the food items ?
*MOT: um I dont know .
*MOT: Imean I think she just like she likes them because she can put them in her mouth .
*MOT: because she really Imean she likes to pick up peas youknow by her herself and put them in her mouth one at a time .
*MOT: like thats she loves really does love peas .
*MOT: um and shes kind of getting the hang of the uh the sippycup .
*MOT: but not really .
*MOT: but usually when she she has one at home .
*MOT: but shell just play with it .
*MOT: shell chomp on it .
*MOT: but she wont really drink out of it .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: and the same thing with the spoon .
*MOT: like shell play with it .
*MOT: but she doesnt she cant really coordinate it to eat anything from it .
*MOT: but play with it bang with it youknow .
*EXP: did she do that today ?
*EXP: did she do something with the spoon ?
*MOT: yeah she was playing with the big spoon little spoon .
*MOT: she was turning them around .
*MOT: she was kind of hitting them a little bit .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: so do you think any of these items the food type things are familiar to her from home at all ?
*MOT: yeah probably the spoon probably the peas .
*MOT: um really I mean not really the .
*MOT: I dont know if shes really seen like cookies like this .
*MOT: but youknow like the little shes had some kind of little like biscuity type things so maybe .
*MOT: but I dont think shes ever seen peas qui .
*MOT: usually she sees them like individual .
*MOT: shes never seen a chunk of peas like this .
*EXP: a lot of moms comment on that .
*MOT: but if you had little small ones I bet the kids would eat them .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: probably would .
*MOT: you probably would eat them .
*MOT: yeah .

*EXP: okay so so compared with last time you feel like shes interested in similar things .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: except for not as much books .
*MOT: less books .
*MOT: um more I think probably more of these little guys .
*MOT: and shes never really been a huge kind of stuffed animal fan .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: how about um baby dolls ?
*EXP: does she have any of these at home ?
*MOT: you know she doesnt have any of them at home .
*MOT: and last time we kind of played with it for a little bit .
*MOT: but youknow I think shes kind of like the same thing with these youknow .
*MOT: same kind of attention span with them .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: lets see .
*EXP: um in general though do you think she prefers toys or books ?
*MOT: you know before I would have said books .
*MOT: but now she seems to like these the toys more .
*MOT: because I think she can do more with them .
*MOT: whereas before she could like turn the pages of the books .
*MOT: and like youknow when they had little things they could lift shed love that .
