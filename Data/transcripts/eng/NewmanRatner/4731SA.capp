*MOT: and its squishy .
*MOT: and its the right size for his hands .
*MOT: and its colorful .

*MOT: he might recognize baby because he has theres a baby doll at home we play with .
*MOT: and um .
*EXP: what about the food ?

*EXP: okay and lets see what else we have .
*EXP: do you have any of these exact same toys at home or books or any ?
*MOT: um we ha the fake pasta looks like stuff we have at home .

*EXP: okay and then I guess you said he was recognizing .

*MOT: he was beelining for the wires last time too .
*MOT: yeah uhhuh .
*EXP: do you think he recognized any of the names of the food ?
*MOT: um I dont know .

*MOT: Imean hes had mushed up peas before .
*MOT: but I dont know if hed specifically recognize the name of pizza or cookie or peas .

*EXP: okay .
*EXP: what about baby dolls ?
*EXP: do you have baby dolls at home ?
*MOT: yeah we have his sister has a baby doll that he chews on her face sometimes .
*EXP: is that what do ya do you with him and .
*EXP: how does he usually play with the baby doll ?
*MOT: um like I said theyre his sisters .
*MOT: so well theres two of them .
*MOT: and they both belong to his sister .
*MOT: she actually does the interactive youknow Im a mommy .
*MOT: Im taking care of my baby play .
*MOT: hell go over and kindof study the features .
*MOT: like why is this little person not moving ?
*MOT: and then like I said he just likes to try and chew on her face .
*MOT: because its its another toy .
*MOT: and he tastes tests everything .
*MOT: anything can get in his mouth he puts there .
*EXP: do you think he recognizes like hand shoe eye ?
*EXP: those types of things .
*MOT: some stuff yeah .
*MOT: like I think eyes nose .
*MOT: I dont know if he knows shoe .
*MOT: um he might .
*MOT: um but I dont know how many of the body parts he really recognizes .
*MOT: for me to say .
*MOT: this is the ear .
*MOT: this is the hand .
*MOT: this is the eye .
*MOT: are you reading books at home ?
*MOT: yup ah we read picture books together .
*MOT: and youknow like the little board books .
*MOT: and then um Im still nursing him .
*MOT: so I generally have one of my older childrens books .
*MOT: that I like Alice in wonderland .
*MOT: or um I forget which one of the Narnia ones is the one we just finished .
*MOT: I think were on HarryPotter now .
*MOT: ah that I just read as youknow as Im nursing him .
*MOT: so not that hes comprehending that .
*MOT: but hes at least hearing it .
*MOT: but then we do yeah we do picture books and stuff .
*EXP: what do you think he likes to play with more at home books or toys ?
*MOT: ah toys .
*MOT: hes much more into toys .
*MOT: hey good boy .
*EXP: um do you have any similar of the s su of same books at home ?
*MOT: ah we have goodnight moon .
*MOT: ah we have MisterBrown can moo .
*MOT: um for some reason MisterBrown can moo is not a favorite at our house .
*MOT: but goodnight moon generally is .
*MOT: but weve got a lot of the other classic ones .
*MOT: but hes just youknow hell chew on the covers .
*MOT: but um I have a two and a half year old whos way more interested in books and reading and stuff than he seems to be at the same ages .
*MOT: but we all still read together .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um what about the um books like the touchy feely books ?
*MOT: ah hes got a truck book that has different textures in it .
*MOT: and he likes going through .
*MOT: and hell use the tip of his finger .
*MOT: and hell hell youknow touch each of the ah textured sections on the pages .
*MOT: he does like the truck book .
*EXP: do you think he likes at this stage more touching or like noises or ?
*MOT: ah touching and um things that he can hold easily in his hand .
*MOT: he likes banging toys together .
*MOT: um we have a lot of little people .
*MOT: and so he likes playing with those .
*MOT: because they fit well in his hands .
*MOT: and theyve got detail .
*MOT: and hell look at them and then chew on them and look at them again .
*EXP: and um how about the farm animals ?
*EXP: or the farm animals .
*EXP: the stuffed animals ?
*MOT: hes never really cared much for stuffed animals .
*MOT: I think the reason that he played with this one is because it has the um the funny hair .
*MOT: um the sticky hair which gave it a different texture .
*MOT: but he doesnt really care about stuff animals .
*MOT: so yeah hes hes definitely into toys more than books or stuffed animals .
*EXP: okay do you think there were any names like even of like domestic pets or animals maybe that youve seen books on ?
*EXP: the names of them that he would be more familiar with ?
*MOT: probably more familiar with like youknow the regular domestic animals .
*MOT: those .
*MOT: youknow like I dont think he knows otter and fox and eagle and fawn which are some of the and goose .
*MOT: um but youknow hes I guess hes starting to comprehend the .
*MOT: um we have a little farm set at home .
*MOT: so cow and horse and .
*MOT: those he seems he chews on the lamb a lot .
*MOT: so Im like .
*MOT: thats the sheep .
*MOT: thats the sheep .
*MOT: but I dont if I said .
*MOT: thats the youknow pick out the sheep .
*MOT: if he would be able to .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: go and select that one .
*MOT: but we go through we generally do more teaching and explaining and talking about the toys than we do with books .
*MOT: just because thats where his interest is .
*MOT: is more with the toys .
*EXP: so if you were to say what he was least interested in today .
*MOT: stuffed animals .
*EXP: and is that different from the last visit ?
*MOT: no he didnt care about the stuffed animals last time either .
*MOT: and he had only medium interest in the books .
*MOT: but liked chewing on the fake food .
*MOT: we have a l a kitchen set and a lot of fake food .
*MOT: so this is most similar to the stuff that he plays with at home .
*MOT: um thank you .
*MOT: does that rattle ?
*MOT: and he was tr like I said he was trying to get the wires last time too .
*MOT: but wires arent one of your categories .
*EXP: yeah haha .
*MOT: yeah ?
*MOT: yeah no you still cant play with them Im sorry .
*EXP: um are the do you think he played similarly here today like he would at home with you ?
*MOT: um yeah theres generally the toys arent necessarily in concentrated piles .
*MOT: so we spend more time kindof going around going from one thing to another .
*MOT: I also have a two and half year old .
*MOT: so a lot of the play that we do is focused around what she says she wants to play w .
*MOT: youknow well be playing with blocks .
*MOT: and hell come .
*MOT: and hell help by knocking over towers and sticking things in his mouth .
*MOT: or were playing in the kitchen .
*MOT: and he sits over by us and puts things in his mouth .
*MOT: common theme with him .
*MOT: ah but yeah Imean obviously its a little more awkward to just be in a concentrated environment than when were at home .
*MOT: but because theres a lot more sibling interaction craziness going on .
*MOT: um at home .
*MOT: but yeah Imean just interacting and talking about stuff .
*MOT: and I try and let him just explore a lot on his own .
*MOT: and just youknow its fun to watch them sit and play with something and try and figure it out .
*MOT: and you can just see the gears turning and .
*MOT: see if you can help them out at some points with it .
*MOT: and other times they dont really need you .
*MOT: they just youknow theyre just having fun .
*EXP: thats right .
*EXP: do you think something with the toys hasta do with .
*EXP: I asked you some type of variation on this but .
*EXP: um the ah colors or more the sounds ?
*MOT: my inexpert opinion .
*MOT: um they bang together neat .
*MOT: they make a sound when they bang together .
*MOT: um theres probably different flavors in the plastics .
*MOT: different textures in the plastics and woods and stuff .
*MOT: more opportunity for noise .
*MOT: whereas stuffed animals I guess they all kindof taste the same .
*MOT: um hes also hes hes teething .
*MOT: so I think its also .
*MOT: it feels good when he chews on hard plastic .
*MOT: like it feels good on his gums to be able to gnaw on things .
*EXP: what do you think he enjoyed the most today ?
*MOT: ah the fake bottles .
*MOT: the little juice cup and the little bottle .
*EXP: is that usually something does he do you have that kind of food at home ?
*MOT: we do .
*MOT: weve got a little pretend kitchen set .
*MOT: and he and his sister spend a lot of time playing at it .
*MOT: and playing with the food .
*MOT: so some of these things we have at home .
*EXP: ah what which ones do you have ?
*MOT: we have the icecream cone .
*MOT: we have pasta that looks similar to that .
*MOT: and the peas .
*MOT: um and have a one fake bottle .
*MOT: but its a fake milk bottle .
*MOT: um we dont have big wooden ones like this .
*MOT: I think he liked the weight of them .
*MOT: he liked playing with the peanutbutter jar .
*MOT: no he doesnt stack so much yet .
*MOT: he likes to knock things down when I stack them .
*MOT: or especially if his sister stacks them .
*MOT: she likes stacking .
*MOT: he likes knocking down .
*MOT: they make a good pair .
*MOT: um today was actually the first time that Id seen him take something gently from the top of the stack instead of just knocking the whole thing over .
*MOT: normally he just likes to go kaboom with them .
*MOT: but today he actually picked something up off the top .
*EXP: do you do you think there are any food items names that he recognizes xxx ?
*MOT: well yeah he Imean he probably recognizes peas because we both eat peas and have toy peas at home .
*MOT: um dont really eat peanutbutter .
*MOT: um and the kids dont really have much juice .
*MOT: but I think he probably just from the playing recognizes it .
*MOT: because his sister does drink juice .
*MOT: he does not .
*MOT: so he may recognize that word as something that hes not normally allowed to have .
*MOT: like no thats Sabrinas juice .
*MOT: um hes also teething .
*MOT: it could just be that he likes gnawing on them because it hits some of the back tee or youknow some of the back gums .
*MOT: hey hey baby .
*MOT: what do you think he liked the least today ?
*MOT: the stuffed animals .
*MOT: every time .
*MOT: he just doesnt care about them .
*MOT: like I I dont know if hes played with them at all when hes been here .
*MOT: and we have stuffed animals at home .
*MOT: and he rarely .
*MOT: unless they have like something jingly inside them .
*MOT: he doesnt he just doesnt care about them .
*EXP: do you think he knows like any of the animal xxx .
*MOT: um he might .
*MOT: um maybe more regular ones like just dog and cat and stuff .
*MOT: he might recognize some of those .
*MOT: but he just doesnt really like playing with stuffed animals .
*EXP: ah how about the books was that a big success today or ?
*MOT: ah hes generally sort of Luke warm about books .
*MOT: um he doesnt hell listen Ill read to him when Im nursing him .
*MOT: and hell listen .
*MOT: and sometimes like when Im burping Ill keep reading to him .
*MOT: um but we dont he doesnt really have the patience to sit and listen to the word books at this point in time .
*MOT: hed rather chew on them .
*MOT: or if he can get his hands on paper books he likes to try and pull the paper because it makes paper .
*MOT: he loves noise .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: you do .
*MOT: um so his interest in the books here is about his interest in the books at home .
*MOT: um if Im reading to his sister he likes to be on my lap too .
*MOT: and well all read together .
*MOT: that is not for you .
*MOT: he loves wires .
*MOT: loves wires .
*MOT: if you had a pile of wires and electronics remotes youknow cameras iphones anything like that thats what he would would play with .
*EXP: ah which books do you did you read today ?
*MOT: um we did put me in the zoo .
*MOT: and what was the other ?
*MOT: oh we looked at the farm one .
*MOT: he does have a touchy um book on um like vehicles .
*MOT: trucks and stuff .
*MOT: that he likes to like to read .
*MOT: that will entertain him when hes in the car .
*MOT: um so I think youknow he guess he likes the the feeling of them .
*MOT: and put me in the zoo he just picked up and handed to me .
*MOT: we dont have this one at home .
*MOT: weve read it before .
*MOT: but we dont have it at home .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: go ahead .
*EXP: Im sorry .
*EXP: I was just gonna ask .
*EXP: what so um just to get the gist of it .
*EXP: what do you think that um everything that he liked today had in common ?
*MOT: hard stuff that he could chew on .
*MOT: hard or hardish .
*MOT: he likes the textures .
*MOT: and he likes things that make noise .
*MOT: so we were its actually it was an idea I got last time when we were here .
*MOT: there was already the little cookie in here .
*MOT: and he liked rattling it back and forth .
*MOT: and so we spent some time putting youknow things .
*MOT: and once I put the first thing in he followed my direction and was putting more stuff in .
*MOT: um but he liked the rattling .
*MOT: um youknow rattling this stuff .
*MOT: and I guess the touch of the the books .
*EXP: you keep grabbing the pizza .
*MOT: oh .
*EXP: is that the most typical thing that he .
*MOT: we dont have this at home .
*MOT: but at our play group theres a .
*MOT: it looks exactly like this just bigger .
*MOT: piece of pizza .
*MOT: its the thing that that they all fight over .
*MOT: theres only one piece .
*MOT: Im sure that there were more at some point in time .
*MOT: and kids probably walked off with the other pieces .
*MOT: I dont know what is so fascinating about it .
*MOT: but he was playing with the pizza .
*MOT: and every time he picked up some .
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: would you like it back ?
*MOT: you cannot have the wire .
*MOT: um so no I dont know whats fas .
*MOT: maybe its the texture .
*MOT: um but he was playing with it a lot .
*MOT: and um yeah its a big favorite at play group too .
*MOT: ah how about the baby doll ?
*MOT: we have a couple baby dolls at home .
*MOT: they are his sisters baby dolls .
*MOT: he occasionally expresses interest in them .
*MOT: mainly when she is trying to play with them .
*MOT: he doesnt really look at them when hes on his own .
*MOT: or when shes not around .
*MOT: um so um I was trying to see if he would look at it and be like .
*MOT: oh look its a baby doll .
*MOT: you can play with it and feed it and stuff like that .
*MOT: are you upside down ?
*MOT: he likes being upside down .
*MOT: hell crawl and put his head on the ground and try and try and do a somersault .
*MOT: likes being upside down .
*MOT: into climbing on everything .
*MOT: yeah the daredevil .
*MOT: yeah very physical .
*EXP: does he play with his sister with the the baby doll ?
*MOT: its generally trying to grab the baby doll and chew on her face .
*MOT: or youknow I think its just its its plastic .
*MOT: its its not real hard .
*MOT: youknow probably felt good against his gums .
*MOT: and it gives the added benefit of ah teasing her because shes trying to play with it .
*MOT: um yeah .
*MOT: thats entertainment most days is them figuring out how to annoy the other one .
*MOT: were there any differences on how he played here today and how he plays at home ?
*MOT: um not a lot .
*MOT: at home we have more um cars and trucks .
*MOT: he likes he likes those a lot .
*MOT: and things with wheels that he can move .
*MOT: and we also have um a lot of little people figures .
*MOT: like the Fisherprice little people .
*MOT: and he likes playing with those .
*MOT: ah but its yeah trucks and little people he likes a lot .
*MOT: um the f so you guys dont have them here .
*MOT: xxx youknow he might have played with them .
*MOT: but yeah he doesnt have much interest in stuffed animals at home either .
*MOT: and xxx interest in books .
*MOT: and youve got a new friend .
*MOT: careful Stevie .
*MOT: do not pull hair .
*MOT: do not pull hair .
*MOT: be gentle .
*MOT: youve gotta be gentle .
*MOT: you do not know your own strength .
*EXP: good listening .
*EXP: look at you .
*EXP: thats sweet .
*EXP: how about across the visits ?
*EXP: do you remember ?
*EXP: you said in common the stuffed animals xxx .
*MOT: hes never really played with the stuffed animals .
*MOT: hes always sort of looked at the books .
*MOT: and has spent most of the time chewing on the food .
*MOT: Imean its its pretty much been the same each of our visits here .
*MOT: um and once or twice making a break for the wires .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: um yeah but its its been pretty common .
*MOT: it its always been the the food that hes played with um the most .
*MOT: but that makes sense for how he plays at home as well .
*MOT: he likes likes playing with that stuff .
*MOT: and um one thing he didnt do today that he normally does at home is um .
*MOT: hes spent a lot of time lately taking two things and banging them against each other .
*MOT: or banging them on the table .
*MOT: like that seems to be his um entertainment of choice recently is the banging .
*MOT: trying to think .
*MOT: what else do you do at home ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah its strange because I dont honestly I dont see him play on his own all that often .
*MOT: because he and his sister are always playing together so that kind of changes the dynamic of things .
*MOT: because the two of them are interacting and either avoiding each other .
*MOT: or one of them is trying to take the others things .
*MOT: either shes trying to take his stuff .
*MOT: or hes trying to take her stuff .
*MOT: and sometimes they trade back and forth and actually play w in the same space nicely .
*MOT: which is awesome .
*MOT: um and really cool to see .
*MOT: um but its its just there isnt much time that he doesnt have somebody else around him .
*MOT: either a play group or with his sister at home thats in the same general space playing with him .
*MOT: so thats I guess a difference of being here versus being at home as well .
*EXP: I was just thinking just having seen him react to you youknow well definitely the no .
*EXP: do you think he knows the name book ?
*MOT: he might he might know book .
*MOT: Im not sure .
*MOT: he does know no .
*MOT: whether or not he chooses to mind me he knows no .
*MOT: he no youknow theres hes got a handful of words that he definitely definitely knows .
*MOT: and the rest of them its its kind of amorphous as to .
*MOT: is it that hes responding to my t like when I said .
*MOT: oh hand me the book .
*MOT: and let me read it to you .
*MOT: he handed it to me .
*MOT: but is it because I said book ?
*MOT: is it because I said hand it to me ?
*MOT: is it because of my tone ?
*MOT: or is it because my hand is out like this ?
*MOT: and thats what hes holding .
*MOT: um because he likes to share .
*MOT: hell come over hell crawl over to me and hand me something .
*MOT: and Ill take it and be like .
*MOT: oh thank you .
*MOT: and hand it back to him .
*MOT: and that makes him happy because hes sharing .
*MOT: um I dont know if he knows the word book .
*MOT: he might .
*EXP: are there any um I dont know maybe xxx any foods that xxx .
*EXP: I guess it depends on what foods hes eating for him to have a level of excitement to eat it .
*MOT: um not really because Imean its a l were still having a lot of junky baby food .
*MOT: Ive been trying to we dont dont really get into the whole baby signing thing .
*MOT: um the two signs that I had learned were more and enough .
*MOT: and so when Ive been feeding him Ive been trying to go .
*MOT: okay do you want more ?
*MOT: you want more ?
*MOT: at which point his two and a half year old sister pipes up .
*MOT: I want more .
*MOT: I want more .
*MOT: like you already have your words .
*MOT: you dont needta do that .
