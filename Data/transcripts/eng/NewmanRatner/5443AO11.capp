*MOT: which is really helpful .
*MOT: I dont know if that says something about me or .

*MOT: she likes building toys .
*MOT: much more into cause and effect um kinds of things .
*MOT: the the little shape the little popper with the animals .
*MOT: where you push the different things .
*MOT: she cant quite work that part yet .
