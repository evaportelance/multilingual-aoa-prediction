*MOT: um at the moment let me just stay here haha .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: haha Ill figure out .
*EXP: Ill see if I can help with the shoes .
*EXP: so um we just wanted to talk about what you guys started playing with today .
*MOT: she was really fixated on shopping .
*MOT: it is sort of what shes been into lately .
*MOT: I think because while I had my broken leg my husband was shopping so they would go shopping together .
*MOT: and so shes into shopping haha .
*MOT: haha so she knows like they get cans .
*MOT: she wouldnt call them cans but she knew she need these and we buy cans .
*MOT: and she was youknow gathering the things she knows we buy and youknow then she went to get baby dolls which has been her big thing lately .
*MOT: and she likes to change their diapers .
*MOT: youknow she needs her diaper changed usually .
*MOT: haha when she wants to change the babys diapers and .
*MOT: and that sort of stuff .
*MOT: so that sort of made sense and then .
*MOT: she was into co wanting to cook .
*MOT: she tries to help cook at home so I could see that .
*MOT: and then we have a pizza cutter for pizza .
*MOT: so she knows that youknow that we make pizza and you cut the pizza and stuff like that .
*MOT: but it seemed like all of these things she thought of them as items she bought .
*MOT: she wasnt interested going in the bags and youknow like Id show he youknow youknow ask her about the zebra and she would throw the zebra there and Im like do you wanna cook the zebra .
*MOT: haha but she wasnt really interested in what was in the containers which is kind of different then .
*MOT: well last time .
*MOT: ouch I just bit my tongue .
*MOT: sorry .
*MOT: last time we didnt have like containers or anything .
*MOT: they were just sort of loose and she would sort of .
*MOT: each times were different of what shes done with the animals .
*MOT: this is sort of the first time shes actually flat out ignored them .
*EXP: yes shes definitely very into the cooking and the shopping .
*EXP: so you said she watches you cook at home ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: and she tries to help .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: does she like watch you cook anything specific ?
*EXP: or is it just ?
*MOT: well like she know like the family makes pizza together so she knows about that .
*MOT: and then yesterday like her brother had a friend over so we all made fudge together so .
*MOT: I mean she just wants to help .
*MOT: like she wants to stir and that sort of stuff but .
*MOT: like we have an electric stove so I was sort of reminding her you cant have youknow put your hands down and be careful with the pots because shell .
*MOT: get burned .
*MOT: so sort of its like sort of the thing that kinda of was the common thing was the thing shes interested in right now which is sort of playing with baby dolls and playing with cooking and shopping .
*MOT: and so .
*MOT: anything else beyond that is .
*MOT: I mean she likes books and all but Imean you saw when as soon as you pull them out first thing shell do is the baby doll and she wanted to go play with the baby doll .
*EXP: so some of this food was there anything that maybe she hadnt seen before ?
*EXP: new foods ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: well the kiwi is something we dont eat .
*MOT: and so she didnt really know what to do with it because shes trying to cut it and cant figure out why its not cutting .
*MOT: but I was surprised she even knew it was something you cut because its not something we eat .
*MOT: um Imean like the foods generally like .
*MOT: I was surprised she knew what green beans were Imean we have it occasionally at home but her brothers hate it so does her husband so does my husband so theyre always like we dont like this and when she said they were beans I was kind of surprised .
*MOT: um but like youknow the meats and stuff like that she knows .
*MOT: I dont think she has any clue what this is .
*EXP: haha yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I mean thats not something .
*EXP: thats fine .
*MOT: yeah thats not something we have around the house .
*MOT: so I wasnt surprised she had no clue and didnt even focus on them .
*MOT: I mean she knows .
*MOT: she didnt go for them she was just more into I wanna shop so I mean she knows about cans and she knows meat and that sort of stuff but it wasnt like .
*MOT: and she wanted to put it in her basket because you know how giant has the little baskets and stuff like and the kids baskets so she gets all of that .
*EXP: does she have baby dolls at home ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: and um she really didnt get into them until the last few months .
*MOT: like the last time we were we were here I guess at eighteen months .
*MOT: thats about the time she started to even look at them .
*MOT: before that she could care less .
*MOT: and then lately shes been more into holding the baby and changing the baby and feeding the baby .
*MOT: all that sort of stuff .
*EXP: does she usually like to put like clothes on them and stuff ?
*MOT: she mostly strips them and then put diapers on and then youknow walks around .
*MOT: oh and she likes to get diaper cream and she goes the baby needs diaper cream on her bottom .
*MOT: haha which is a little disturbing .
*MOT: because shes like gotta and she wants to put lotion on the baby .
*MOT: she needs lotion .
*MOT: she has dry skin .
*MOT: but shes like the baby needs lotion .
*MOT: and yeah .
*MOT: but watching her change the baby doll the other day was kind of interesting .
*MOT: she goes oh and I needta go get wipes .
*MOT: I needta wipe the babys bottom and Im like you needta go the potty haha .
*MOT: so but she doesnt really spend time dressing .
*MOT: its mostly stripping hugging kissing feeding diap diapering .
*MOT: but like this is the like putting clothes on is the most Ive seen her do .
*MOT: putting clothes on because she doesnt normally do that .
*EXP: and were there any other toys that maybe I know the animals anything you tried to get her to play with that she wasnt really interested in ?
*MOT: no I think she would have been more interested in this if she could figure out instantly whether or not it was a puzzle .
*MOT: um because the first thing she sort of said is this is a puzzle and then shes looking down looking for like well wheres the design to put the pieces in and shes like oh theres the baby doll .
*MOT: wheres the pot ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: I think she would have been more interested in that and then .
*MOT: she she didnt seem to get the tool thing .
*MOT: I dont know why .
*MOT: that was kind of weird .
*MOT: she didnt seem to be interested in that .
*MOT: she was thinking this was more of a bib .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: but she youknow I was trying to get her to focus on hammer and that sort of stuff but shes like wheres the baby ?
*MOT: wheres the cooking ?
*MOT: which is funny because she has older brothers and she plays .
*MOT: I mean a lot of her toys are her brothers toys that they had and just have kept them all .
*MOT: so she youknow hammers on like the xxx .
*MOT: workbench sort of thing xxx .
*MOT: but she didnt seem to focus on it much .
*MOT: so are there any other Imean besides the tools any other toys that she has at home that we didnt have here that she usually plays with ?
*MOT: um toys that she plays with .
*MOT: shes um into like the little she has a little um a little Einstein rocket car so she kinda goes around the house and plays with that or she got like a trampoline for christmas .
*MOT: a little little one for her so she kinda plays with that now like she jumps on that .
*MOT: and and um .
*MOT: brothers play hockey so youknow theres many sticks around the house so she does that .
*MOT: and she plays with balls .
*MOT: so then she kicks the balls and does that sort of stuff .
*MOT: um Im trying to think toys perse .
*MOT: Imean she likes more the manipulative books .
*MOT: so like she likes these and youknow she knows goodnight moon .
*MOT: but like Santa brought her a potty training book that has like a little button that youknow you hear the toilet flushing or um the Thomas tank engine books that youknow if you see the picture you push and you get a noise .
*MOT: that that sort of stuff she likes with books .
*MOT: Imean shell usually sit down I think maybe she was getting a little .
*EXP: had a long day .
*EXP: was there anything you noticed today about her play that um was a little different from what she normally does or was it pretty much ?
*MOT: its more its the the difference was more from what she did the last time we were here .
*MOT: Imean its the play was definitely on what shes interested in now .
*MOT: its funny like as weve done this the first time she was really attracted to color .
*MOT: like the bright stuff she was focused on .
*MOT: if it was red or orange or pink she was there .
*MOT: it couldnt she recognized sort of was starting to recognize food but it was more that the bright colors thats where she was .
*MOT: and then the next time it was more she was into the animals and things that she recognized and food and stuff like that .
*MOT: she wasnt how do I say it she wasnt putting everything together .
*MOT: versus now she could sort of see her focus on something and it sort of fits into a an area versus what she useta do .
*MOT: like shell play with the dolls and like have something to do or shes like okay Im going shopping and Im doing all of that .
*MOT: versus like the first time shes like youknow I see pizza .
*MOT: you know when she was talking pizza or this or that .
*MOT: but she wouldnt go and next thing okay let me go find the things that go on the pizza or let me go take it to the stove .
*MOT: the other thing is the toys are a little bit more mature too .
*EXP: yeah I understand that .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: because I remember the .
*MOT: these things werent this was here before but this wasnt here before .
*MOT: as I mentioned these were xxx xxx xxx xxx .
*MOT: and I think there were little puzzles before where she would play with it .
*EXP: great .
*EXP: she did a great job today .
*EXP: we really we got through .
*EXP: shes polite .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: sorry shes a little piggy today .
*EXP: shes so sociable .
*EXP: you really feel like you can have a conversation .
*EXP: yeah shes a little quiet at first and then all of the sudden she just opened up .
*EXP: just talking and talking .
*EXP: it was great .
*MOT: usually shes a little .
*MOT: she goes through phases .
*MOT: sometimes she like when we first got here shell be like youknow hi youknow .
*MOT: in the past and then I think you know shes getting through that stranger thing so shes sort of like wheres mommy and then .
*EXP: which isnt bad .
*MOT: yeah .
