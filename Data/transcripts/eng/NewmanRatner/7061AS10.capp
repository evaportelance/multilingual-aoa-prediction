*MOT: we dont and I dont know if thats why because it looks different .
*MOT: she doesnt have a lot of stuffed animals either .
*MOT: so I I dont know why she gravitated towards that .
*MOT: the food that she was most interested in .
*EXP: uh and was there a particular food that she was most interested in ?
*MOT: the pizza .
*MOT: she kept grabbing .
*EXP: and wa what was she least interested in ?
*MOT: um she did look over at that stuff but she didnt even care about the stuffed animals .
*EXP: uh and does she have any stuffed animals at home she plays with ?
*MOT: she has um an abbykadabby .
*MOT: and um she has a um a bigger teddy bear .
*MOT: that she kinda looks at but shes not really interacted with .
*EXP: um and she was looking at the books over there do you read books at home ?
*MOT: we read books I think she was more looking at this .
*EXP: oh she was looking at the xxx .
*MOT: but um I dont know what she was really looking at because she didnt grab for anything .
*EXP: uh and did she look at the doll at all ?
*MOT: not that I noticed .
*EXP: so it was all food uh do you play any kind of games at home like .
*MOT: um yeah we do races at home because shes a fast crawler now and um we have a dog so she just learned how to throw .
*MOT: so now we play fetch before she would sit on my lap and we would play fetch and tug .
*MOT: um we do peekaboo but she doesnt seem interested in that .
*MOT: shes bored with that .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: sometimes she likes bubbles sometimes she doesnt .
*MOT: theres no really way to tell .
*MOT: it just depends on her mood that day .
*MOT: um and she has this um wire .
*MOT: a toy where you move the balls .
*EXP: okay oh yeah yeah .
*MOT: and she likes that .
*MOT: we play with that .
*EXP: yeah are you still playing with food ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: uh and has there been any changes since your last visit ?
*EXP: like which toys she is playing with etcetera .
*MOT: no it last time she gravitated towards the food as well .
*MOT: last time she grabbed one of the stuffed animals but didnt kinda like grabbed it and then saw the food and moved on .
*EXP: um and was she interested in the same kind of food did she pick up the pizza a lot ?
*EXP: do you remember ?
*MOT: I dont remember I think she was playing a lot with the spaghetti last time and the peas .
*MOT: she held the peas the longest .
*MOT: yeah you didnt even see them huh got to focused on the pizza .
*EXP: and why do you think she was the most disinterested in the stuffed animals xxx .
*MOT: I dont know maybe just cause we dont have a lot the one we have is bigger and so she doesnt manipulate it very well .
*MOT: I guess shes just not interested in them .
*EXP: yeah um .
*EXP: do you have any of these foods like does she see you cooking with them or do you and your husband .
*MOT: um she just started eating finger foods .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and shes had little cut up spaghetti before .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: but everything elses shes had doesnt look like this it looks pureed .
*MOT: um unless she has noticed eating sandwiches or pizza or whatever but .
*MOT: um the only thing thats here that she has eaten uh whole is spaghetti .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: but it doesnt look like this its cut up .
*EXP: yeah haha .
*EXP: uh and does she and has she been trying to use any utensils lately when shes been eating her food ?
*MOT: she tries to use the spoon um but it doesnt really work .
*MOT: Imean she she kinda gets the concept like that its sposta go towards her mouth .
*MOT: but um shell either hold the spoon backwards or hold it upside down and the food falls off .
*MOT: so sometimes if we let her have the spoon shell take it and then grab it with the other hand and just shove it in her mouth .
*MOT: but she hasnt actually used the spoon .
*EXP: thats cool xxx so little .
*MOT: yup .
*EXP: youre so little .
*EXP: and when youre at home what books does she like to read ?
*MOT: she likes um well right now I dont know if I can say its her favorite because she speak for herself .
*MOT: but she likes um um .
*MOT: GoodNightGorilla because when we read it she giggles .
*MOT: I think shes sort of anticipating like the next page um and we always point out the mouse .
*MOT: like well read the words and then well point out the mouse .
*MOT: um but she also really likes um anything thats soft that she can hold herself .
*MOT: she likes that .
*MOT: and anything that has Elmo on the page .
*MOT: because she recognizes him so if Elmo is in the book she likes it .
*EXP: yeah you like Elmo ?
*MOT: yup .
*EXP: and you said you didnt that she doesnt play with food at home .
*MOT: we dont have food toys we have a little um stuffed pot .
*MOT: like its a silver pot um and it has um I dont know if its an apple or a beet but it it looks its round and red that goes in it .
*MOT: but she doesnt play with the food itself she plays with the pot .
*MOT: um but its not hard plastic like this its um fabric material .
*EXP: yeah ?
*EXP: and does she do anything else at home playing wise that we should know about ?
*MOT: she likes to pull herself up now and thats kind of her own little game that she does with herself .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: um shes trying to stand independently so shell actually spend a lot of time shell let go with one hand .
*MOT: and then shell sort of lean back and think about letting go and that kind of occupies her for a while .
*MOT: um and we also have um animal magnets on the fridge .
*MOT: so um that only holds her attention for about five minutes .
*MOT: but shell play with them and take them off and put them off and thats it .
*MOT: what else do you do ?
*MOT: hm what else ?
*EXP: uh I guess now that shes getting older she is just getting into things .
*EXP: when she was a little younger was she big on any other toys at home ?
*MOT: um she really liked her um its not she had the playmate with like the arches and she was okay with that but we had one that was separate um that was like an arch with three pulleys on it .
*MOT: and when you pulled them it made music .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: and she loves that .
*MOT: she actually still plays with that .
*MOT: we keep thinking that well put it away and uh shell see it across the room and just randomly play with it one day .
*MOT: um but thats what she liked when she was younger she loved the pulling thing .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: we are all done then .
*MOT: all done .
*EXP: were all done .
