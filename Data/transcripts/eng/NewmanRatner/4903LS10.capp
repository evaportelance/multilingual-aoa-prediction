*EXP: okay .
*EXP: Im just gonna ask your mom some questions okay Lucas ?
*EXP: um well um I think we asked you this last time too but which this visit which toys do you think interested him the most ?
*MOT: this clock thing was pretty major .
*MOT: um and then he liked the two things that he could bang together those two blocks he does a lot of that at home .
*MOT: I would say .
*EXP: and um why do you think those things in particular any ideas ?
*MOT: I thi this was new .
*MOT: you know this was different .
*EXP: havent seen that before .
*MOT: havent seen that before .
*MOT: although we have like cl I mean hes yeah I mean we dont have like the clock puzzle out or anything for him .
*MOT: and he likes to bang things together Im not sure if that was part of it and there are lots of dolls at home youknow I was surprised to see him kind of pull her up and try to .
*MOT: help her sit up .
*MOT: um I think my daughter does that to him .
*EXP: oh thats interesting .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: does he usually play with dolls at home or try ?
*MOT: hes trying to get her stuff all the time so it doesnt matter what he has in front of him hes trying to go for .
*MOT: what hes not sposta have so .
*EXP: so he plays with whatever she .
*MOT: right I mean hes got youknow pink phone whatever it is like theres nothing .
*EXP: as long as she has it .
*MOT: as long as she has it or .
*EXP: thats attractive .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: but your sister wasnt here with you today .
*EXP: so thats an interesting thing to see what youll do without her .
*MOT: yeah if hell go for .
*EXP: um which of the toys here do you think he would be interested the least ?
*MOT: overall books right now .
*MOT: are not his thing like I hafta kind of read to him usually from a distance because he wants to grab it .
*MOT: tear pages or ri youknow or eat it so .
*MOT: even the fpcar even the hard page books like this youknow .
*MOT: kind of sit him at a distance to try get a few books in .
*MOT: before he wants to destroy them .
*EXP: so books would probably be at the bottom .
*EXP: um and I heard you saying something um about having like dishes and food toys and stuff like that at home ?
*MOT: we dont have a lot of the food stuff we have dishes yes and I just thought maybe .
*MOT: he would wanna play with those since .
*MOT: youknow at home she doesnt want him playing with that .
*MOT: you wanna stand up today is today the day ?
*EXP: type of stuff but not that one ?
*MOT: right and my yeah my daughter is at like that point where she is trying to learn to tell time and stuff .
*MOT: but li its theres nothing around thats in his area to play I mean we have one of those clock puzzles youknow where you just put the pieces in where the times go .
*MOT: but its too small for him to be handling it yet and I dont even think hes seen it .
*MOT: so Im imagining that that was just maybe the novelty of it and the face and the youknow the co the colors .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay and lets see .
*EXP: um if he w were to hear a bo you were to do a book with him at home are there any that you think he likes more than others like are there standard ones or things that ?
*EXP: he likes to hear often ?
*MOT: he likes the youknow he li I mean the stuff that rhymes youknow like theres theres a um like the pajama time the Sandra Boynton stuff .
*MOT: we have a few of those the rhyming stuff is kind of the sing songy .
*MOT: type things he will listen and he is Im fi Im finding that his attention span attention span is getting better .
*MOT: and um so he do Im like oh I hafta go back to trying that because in the beginning I was like oh this is just too frustrating for me to have him youknow .
*MOT: wanna tear out pages .
*EXP: I know what you are going after buddy I know .
*MOT: you want that microphone dont you ?
*EXP: that wouldnt be good for a guy like you .
*EXP: does he play with his sisters dolls at all I mean .
*EXP: he might look interested in them but I guess um .
*MOT: I dont know yeah I dont know if hes only going for it because he knows thats she has one in particular that she carries around with her all the time .
*MOT: and youknow and it has a bl youknow she has a blanket that is kind of her little security thing .
*MOT: and um I think he might want it because she always has it .
*MOT: I dont really know .
*MOT: the toy itself I dont know if he would be really interactive youknow and try to .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: try to do some playing with .
*MOT: right but I dont think so .
*MOT: although I was surprised by what he did with her .
*MOT: yeah yeah there seems to be something going on .
*EXP: he doesnt play with the baby yet does he ?
*EXP: um lets see oh do you think he recognizes the names for any of these types of items ?
*MOT: not really youknow .
*MOT: on that questionaire um I said maybe he would understand book or maybe he would understand water or milk but I .
*MOT: dont Im not really sure about that .
*EXP: it sounded like he was trying to say clock but he was probably just .
*MOT: imitating the word yeah because I .
*MOT: I was like that would be really surprising if today right here would be his first word youknow .
*EXP: he seemed to be having fun playing that kind of game with you though .
*MOT: yeah and you know the imitating .
*EXP: and having a little conversation back and forth .
*MOT: yeah Lucas .
*MOT: do you know where the clock is ?
*MOT: wheres the clock ?
*MOT: huh ?
*MOT: do you know where the clock is ?
*MOT: can you find the clock ?
*MOT: my goodness youre right .
*MOT: so maybe .
*MOT: but I just .
*MOT: now my husband is really into clocks and stuff but we havent really done any like focus like were gonna learn youknow .
*MOT: like we got the yyy right yeah I mean this is not something that we .
*EXP: if he is particularly good at clock things at this point .
*MOT: no exactly were not looking into were not were not trying to design his profession today .
*MOT: determine his future career goals .
*EXP: um if you if you had him on your lap with a book would he would he turn pages himself or would he like you to read it read it to him ?
*EXP: which one do you think he would prefer ?
*MOT: um I think he would try to turn the pages himself .
*MOT: yeah hes not real patient with .
*EXP: alright I think thats all .
*EXP: that I was gonna ask you .
*EXP: and um oh I know one last question I dont know exactly what he played with the first time but .
*EXP: um do you think his interests in toys or anything of these things have changed ?
*EXP: since the last time he was here ?
*MOT: he played more this time I dont remember what happened last time .
*MOT: that he just to not really be I dont know if it was just the time of I dont know what it was .
*MOT: but he just wasnt so into it that it was hard for me to get him interested in anything so I read to him a little bit .
*MOT: I did this I did that but he just seemed to .
*EXP: yyy more interested in the objects .
*MOT: right I mean today youknow I sit him down and hes like Im gonna go for something and theres just you know a lot of variety to choose from .
*MOT: and last time I dont know what the variety was but there was a lot .
*MOT: and he just seemed to not I I seemed to hafta bring things to him and show him and try to engage him .
*MOT: this time he seemed to direct it .
*MOT: I mean this thing is phenomenal .
*EXP: I think thats all needed to do so .
