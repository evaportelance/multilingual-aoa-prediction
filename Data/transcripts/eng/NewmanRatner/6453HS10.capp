*MOT: um probably the waffle or the icecream cone .
*EXP: why do you think that she liked those ?
*MOT: um just because she probably is .
*MOT: or the spoons .
*MOT: I dunno she just spends a lot of time spent a lot of time playing with those toys .
*MOT: Hailey .
*MOT: Hailey .
*MOT: thats not really a toy .
*MOT: here honey .
*EXP: always happens right about the end .
*EXP: shes like Mommys not paying attention to me Im gonna grab something else .
*MOT: keys .
*EXP: are they stuff that she eats ?
*EXP: the waffles and ?
*MOT: um no .
*MOT: she eats like little itty bitty finger food so none of it resembles things here .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so shes not that familiar with them .
*MOT: Imean shes more familiar with spoons but .
*EXP: does she have um do you think that she knows any of the names of the some of the foods that you played with today ?
*MOT: um probably not .
*MOT: because she doesnt ever see it like this .
*MOT: maybe like that because she has pasta but um .
*EXP: oops .
*MOT: uhoh .
*EXP: uhoh spaghettio .
*MOT: oh well get you cleaned up .
*MOT: well get you cleaned up .
*MOT: I heard some gurgles .

*MOT: no wonder Hailey .
*MOT: xxx new shirt .
*MOT: uhuh uhoh uhoh .
*MOT: ew .
*EXP: party in there .
*MOT: alright kiddo .
*MOT: clean .
*EXP: what were what was something that she didnt like to play with ?
*MOT: um she really wasnt interested in any of the stuffed toys except for this .
*MOT: she was really interested in that but .
*MOT: um she doesnt play with stuffed toys very much .
*MOT: even though we offer them at home .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: she doesnt really play with them .
*EXP: so its pretty much similar to here .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: do you do you think she knows or is familiar with the animal names ?
*EXP: do you talk about animal names ?
*MOT: we do now um in books mainly .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: we Imean she probably doesnt know all of them like that we of through in her books but .
*MOT: she probably knows dog cat because we have them at home .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but um probably .
*MOT: I think she recognized it like she understands bee .
*MOT: she knows what a bee is .
*MOT: but other than that I dont think so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: not yet .
*EXP: um did she like playing with the doll ?
*MOT: I was surprised she didnt seem interested in it at first but she kept on going back to it .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: albeit very roughly .
*MOT: she yeah she went back to it so I was surprised .
*MOT: I had never seen her with the doll so .
*MOT: we dont have any of those at home for her yet .
*MOT: so yeah I was surprised to see that she was interested .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: what kinds of things were was she doing with it ?
*MOT: um well very roughly patting its head .
*MOT: um and playing with the babys arms but .
*MOT: um mainly just patting .
*EXP: um were you trying to get her to play with it in any particular way ?
*MOT: um I I tried to I guess I tried to bring her closer to the doll .
*MOT: and um I talked about it .
*MOT: um and I guess I just when she like engaged with it I sort of encouraged it but I didnt like try to push it on her after I saw that she wasnt really interested in the beginning so .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: uh how about books .
*MOT: she up until now unless its a touch and feel book she pretty much just besides a few books that we have at home she doesnt she mainly listen like I just read it to her as shes playing .
*MOT: she doesnt really listen to books yet .
*MOT: so we s but there are a few books that we have at home that shes shes mainly for the tactile .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: so shes into more like the tou the feeling .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yeah if it has that sort of thing then shes engaged but if its just like a flat book she doesnt seem interested .
*EXP: how about um in general what do you think she likes most about her toys ?
*EXP: do you think its like texture color noise ?
*MOT: probably noise .
*MOT: we have a lot of toys with noise in them .
*MOT: um and tactile .
*MOT: I think .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but .
*MOT: probably those two .
*EXP: what do you think in here kind of fits into that into those categories for her .
*MOT: probably tactile because she was playing with the food toys mainly and she was like putting it into her mouth and manipulating it so .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um yeah probably the the play food .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: like none of it makes noise so .
*MOT: she would definitely have been engaged with something with noise .
*MOT: um but yeah mainly the the play food .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: does she is she using spoons ?
*MOT: um we let her try to use a spoon at home .
*MOT: it doesnt really work yet .
*MOT: shes just beginning .
*MOT: for right now .
*EXP: has she um and then is she is she eating more solid foods ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: are any of them in here ?
*MOT: she has like pieces of bread and shell have pieces of pasta and pieces of cheese .
*MOT: but no we never just give her like the whole piece .
*EXP: mhm .

*EXP: and so you dont ever play with shes not really into stuffed animals at home ?
*MOT: shell play with them but like minimally .
*MOT: shell pl shell touch it pick it up look at it and then put it down .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: figure out what it is and then leave it alone ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: pretty much .
*MOT: if it doesnt make noise or like feel or react shes not as interested .
*MOT: shes not as engaged .
*MOT: Hailey thats not a toy Im sorry honey .
