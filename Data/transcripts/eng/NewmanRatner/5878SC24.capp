*MOT: he noticed the dolls first I think thats pretty novel .
*MOT: we have one thats like buried somewhere because theyre relatively uninterested in it .
*MOT: so he knows the dolls first but we definitely food is a big thing probably because hes a little bit hungry but every time weve come in the food is interesting we dont have any .
*MOT: I shouldnt say we dont have any we have very little play food .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay so what was he interested I guess specifically .
*MOT: interesting he definitely recognized some of his favorite foods .
*MOT: and then he picked a couple novel foods like cheese is his favorite .
*MOT: right we hafta like ration the cheese .
*MOT: and then like novel things like .
*MOT: and I think he was very interested in the really lifelike textured foods .
*MOT: the like rubbery foods were very interesting .
*MOT: what else .
*MOT: theyre in the juice .
*MOT: drinking is a fun thing .
*MOT: he doesnt get he can but he doesnt get juice in a cup very often because hes a scientist and everything hasta go into the juice and it hasta be poured and then .
*MOT: its very messy experience .
*MOT: its all about texture .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: um so were there any of the foods that he had never seen before ?
*MOT: beets definitely and I dont think he recognized the tuna .
*MOT: which is interesting hes really interested like he could tell it was probably meat but .
*MOT: hes never really seen it like that before .
*MOT: and yeah the beets were interesting to him .
*MOT: for whatever reason Im trying to think I dont think weve ever had beets .
*MOT: my husband doesnt like them .
*MOT: Im trying to think if Ive ever just had them I dont think hes ever had beets .
*EXP: um anything else hed never really had ?
*MOT: Im trying to think .
*MOT: I know hes had pickles .

*EXP: not like the play food but in real life .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: and um any specific ones that he .
*MOT: gree the green beans and the cheese bread and sometimes pizza not very often .
*MOT: we dont have it very often .
*MOT: um he didnt play with alot of the other ones that he eats on a regular basis .
*MOT: the icecream cone .
*MOT: and the peach .
*MOT: we have regularly .
*EXP: and does he like to pretend to cook and those kinds of things is that something he does at all ?
*MOT: yes he has a little we have a little toy kitchen and he kinda rotates through it .
*MOT: like hes interested in it for a whole day and then he wont be interested in it for multiple days right ?
*MOT: um hes becoming more interested in it lately like the last few weeks .
*MOT: probably uh before it was more like a push the buttons make the noises and things like that and hes starting to do more mimickery now like Im drinking Im pouring that sort of thing .
*EXP: he was making a what was it that you were making ?
*MOT: an open faced sandwich .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: a tuna melt .
*EXP: sounded pretty good .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: except for the things that were a little uh .
*MOT: pizza and the tuna I dont know if I can go for that .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: um so uh what else besides the food was he interested in ?
*MOT: uh he was interested in the dolls .
*MOT: um he was trying to figure out what to do with them like how to even play with them Im like what do you wanna do with the dolls and hes like I dunno .
*EXP: so you said he doesnt really play with them at home ?
*MOT: not very much .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: like um our animal and people play has been mostly like figures .
*MOT: and he has hes heavily influenced by his older brother .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: as far as play goes because he likes they like to play together to a certain extent .
*MOT: theyre not always together theyre not always interacting .
*MOT: so and superheroes are a big deal .
*MOT: to the four year old .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: those become youknow valued commodities so were playing with little figures mostly .
*MOT: little pilots and little whatever else .
*MOT: and heroes .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: oh so .
*MOT: so yeah not as often with a doll .
*MOT: with a doll .
*EXP: so was this kind of a new experience with all the youknow .
*MOT: I think definitely with the clothes .
*MOT: like the doll we have doesnt have I should say it doesnt have easily removable clothes so they dont really usually bother with it .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: so that was something new he hadnt really done that before .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: did he seem interested in it at all ?
*MOT: I think so .
*MOT: it was I was kind of wondering to myself youknow like how interested is he actually in this because Im not sure .
*MOT: how much was intrigue and how much was I wanna do something with this .
*MOT: versus what is this and why is she doing this .
*MOT: why is she wearing a skirt over her pants .
*EXP: um was there anything else he was interested in today ?
*MOT: I dont know I pointed out a couple other things and he didnt they were just not interesting as this so .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: yeah he definitely I know was interested in the food and that was a key thing to him .
*EXP: are some of these other toys things he has at home ?
*MOT: no we dont really have very many animals .
*MOT: at home .
*MOT: and he is becoming more interested in animals but not a ton .
*EXP: mhm .

*MOT: definitely .
*EXP: okay so what ?
*MOT: cars trains and trucks .
*MOT: the majority of his play .
*MOT: cars trains and trucks .
*EXP: that seems to be a common Imean xxx .
*MOT: for boys yeah .
*EXP: we dont have any cars trains or trucks .
*MOT: theres nothing with wheels in here .
*EXP: I know .
*MOT: airplanes too .
*MOT: we have alot of airplanes .
*MOT: which is interesting because his I watch his imaginative play developing right now .
*MOT: youknow where um you hear them making conversations and things like that in and day to day activities .
*MOT: but theyre all cars .
*MOT: like talking to each other .
*MOT: and cars hanging out together right so theyre like taking people roles and thats a very easy natural transition for him .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: its kinda funny we have little people but hell grab the cars instead .
*EXP: yeah Imean its hes doing it .
*MOT: we hafta personify them yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: was there anything you noticed today that was different from um previous play sessions ?
*MOT: definitely like the dolls he hasnt been interested in .
*MOT: the last few play sessions .
*MOT: hes been its been like a whats that thats a doll pick it up put it down and then hes done but today he actually wanted to mess around with them a little bit .
*MOT: but hes been very intrigued by the food .
*MOT: all the times weve come in .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: like its hard xxx last time I tried to get him to look at some of the animals and things and just .
*MOT: I wanna eat food .
*MOT: play food .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: um and did you um notice anything with his play today with maybe different from what he does at home you feel like ?
*EXP: I know the toys are a little different but .
*MOT: trying to think .
*MOT: Imean its definitely its always different when it comes to these play sessions because theres not another child .
*MOT: there and so that is definitely a different aspect like my one on one play time with him really limited .
*MOT: its usually interrupted .
*MOT: like its frequently interrupted right ?
*MOT: so that and that thats different like that we can keep a train of thought and work on things .
*MOT: were uh play through things .
*MOT: see them all the way through like we could have a whole conversation about the food .
*EXP: mhm right .
*EXP: so did you notice anything else today that you wanted to bring up anything you saw or .
*MOT: I dont think so .
*EXP: well I know he had um .
*EXP: it was a little rough at the beginning but .
