*EXP: really ?
*MOT: well Imean xxx she chews on everything she likes so .
*MOT: Id say clock or yeah pretty much .
*MOT: probably the clock is best .
*MOT: she didnt seem that interested in the babydoll which is surprises me .
*EXP: you tried to play with does it does she play with it at home .
*MOT: uh she has a soft one .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: but this ones looks completely different so .
*MOT: her her doll at home is her favorite toy so .
*EXP: how does she play with it at home ?
*MOT: uh shell like give it hugs and when as soon as she sees it shell like squeal with delight .
*MOT: she loves she loves the doll so .
*MOT: Im surprise thats why I was pushing this one because we never gotten her one of these before .
*EXP: were you trying to get her to play with it in similar ways today ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: Imean normally at home we dont hafta push the other doll on her because she likes it so much but yeah um .
*MOT: I was probably pushing it more than I would at home so .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: that makes sense .
*EXP: um did you try to get into any of the .
*EXP: oh uh you had mentioned books are not .
*MOT: shes not a big fan of books yet I have a million at home .
*MOT: and I try every day to read to her and we .
*MOT: unless they have things to feel she doesnt seem that interested .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: we try though .
*EXP: she liked that book ?
*MOT: she didnt go for it .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: she wouldnt go for that one .
*MOT: she look she listened for about a page of that peekaboo book .
*MOT: and she perked up when I said peekaboo because we do that at home so .
*EXP: oh cool .
*MOT: but other than that she didnt seem very interested .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: do you um does she recognize the names of animals ?
*EXP: or do you think shes familiar do you do a lot of like animal names at home ?
*MOT: um the ones around the house yes .
*MOT: and Ive tried like she knows bunny .
*MOT: she knows a few .
*MOT: none of the ones in this book .
*MOT: like she has the things she has stuffed animals we name at home a lot but .
*MOT: we dont mention any of these other animals in here so .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: do you have any like similar stuffed animals at home ?
*MOT: um we have we have a bunny we have dogs we have .
*MOT: not nothing like not none of these .
*MOT: like we dont have one of the an otter .
*MOT: we have like PoohBear and things .
*MOT: but nothing we dont s like label them .
*MOT: we dont have ones that have specific labels like zebra .
*MOT: we just have basic animals like dog and bunny and bear .
*EXP: and you like you la you give them human names ?
*MOT: we I always attach like if we name it for her we have the name and then we like BellatheBunny .
*MOT: youknow we always like attach both to it so she so she begins to learn the the name of it I guess ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: with the same sound you mean ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: or Imean we call one of her dogs Abby but its sort of a joke of ours .
*MOT: but yeah we do say the dog so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: how did she um so out of all the toys what do you think was her least favorite ?
*MOT: um she didnt seem to become interested in any of the stuffed toys that I offered her .
*MOT: so probably the stuffed toys .
*MOT: in general .
*MOT: she seemed pretty interested in all the various food .
*MOT: I guess the books .
*MOT: would be more likely .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I guess she was least interested in the books .
*EXP: do you think um any of the food looks familiar or are names that shes heard in your house ?
*MOT: um like for the .
*MOT: shes only had peas out of all of this .
*MOT: so she recognized that because I I always tell her what Im feeding her .
*MOT: so and its usually a fruit or veggie .
*MOT: so yeah that would probably be the only one she recognizes besides like the bottle .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: is she still drinking out of the bottle or are you trying to ?
*MOT: were transitioning to a sippycup for her .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah but shes catching on quickly so .
*MOT: you are just moving around arent you ?
*MOT: youve never seen pizza .
*MOT: yeah thats a new one .
*EXP: uh sometimes sitting all in a pile of toys being surrounded by toys is more fun than actually playing with them .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: xxx its like xxx .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: I dont think shes ever been surrounded by this many toys before .
*MOT: it was a little hard to f make her focus on one I think .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: yeah I can imagine .
*MOT: you like that peanutbutter though huh ?
*MOT: yeah ?
*EXP: does she usually like uh spoons and ?
*EXP: what kind of toys does she play with a lot at home ?
*MOT: um she has a lot of the shapes and um .
*MOT: Imean I let her I let her play with a spoon when Im getting ready to .
*MOT: like one of her spoons .
*MOT: to so when Im getting her food ready so that she can sort of figure out how to hold it eventually .
*MOT: were not teaching her that yet but were just letting her sort of play with it .
*MOT: but um she has a lot of like I said shapes and a lot of interactive toys .
*MOT: like with noise and a lot of those little tykes toys .
*MOT: she pushes things or pulls it .
*MOT: like her one of her favorite is one of those tables and you hafta do different things like pull the lever or spin the thing .
*MOT: turn the page .
*MOT: she really likes those .
*MOT: anything that she can sort of get a reaction out of by doing some sort of action .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: otherwise she does this .
*MOT: she just sort of .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: you are so busy .
*EXP: how do you generally um get her attention ?
*MOT: uh just call her name or sometimes we hafta make silly noises .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: and shes but if she doesnt wanna look away from what shes doing she wont .
*MOT: theres no .
*MOT: she is single minded .
*MOT: like when shes doing something and doesnt wanna be interrupted theres theres no chance .
*MOT: so yeah we call her name or make a silly noise or say look .
*MOT: and other than thats pretty much it .
*MOT: uhoh .
*EXP: there she goes .
