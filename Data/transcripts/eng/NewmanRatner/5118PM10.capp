*EXP: anything you could think of ?
*MOT: um he usually goes after the electronics .
*MOT: we have tons of different toys for him but the ones he picks are my cellphone or the remote or the telephone .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: those toys are the ones that catches his attention the most .
*MOT: we gave him a keyboard of a computer just for him .
*MOT: but he still tries to get ours instead .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: just electronics are his favorites .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: oh I think theres one more .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: do you remember which food toys he played with specifically ?
*MOT: uh well the burger now .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: um the bean the peas he picked up .
*MOT: but pretty much anything I handed him he tossed .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: the maybe the bottle and the cup he liked a little more .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: the cup he tried to drink out of .
*MOT: he was scared of this last time and hes picking it up himself so .
*EXP: oh really ?
*EXP: yeah its kinda weird looking .
*MOT: yeah I dont know if hes he kinda like made a face but he still picked it up so thats good .
*EXP: it looks I dunno its funny looking .
*MOT: its that hair that wiggly hair that scares him .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: okay I think that is it .
*MOT: alright .
*EXP: okay so lets find out what do you think if anything is different about the kinds of things he liked today versus last time ?
*MOT: um I think I remember last time him throwing a lot of stuff .
*MOT: he really didnt want anything at all .
*MOT: he wanted the baby he played the baby and he threw everything else .
*MOT: um this time hes actually picking up more than one thing at a time .
*MOT: and he wasnt doing that before either on when we did the play thing as far as I can remember .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: hes more interested in the other things and not just because he can put them in his mouth .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: but hes actually like using the spoon the way its sposta be useta feed the baby and .
*EXP: hes playing differently as well .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: definitely .
*EXP: wow .
*EXP: thats those are big changes .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: its amazing just a couple weeks how it can make such a change .
*EXP: I know .
*MOT: we dont have any play food at home .
*EXP: I was gonna ask you of these toys do you have um stuffed animals babydolls ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: books ?
*MOT: um we have some stuffed animals .
*MOT: we have books .
*MOT: we really only have books like in his bedroom .
*MOT: I have a book downstairs but he never never like plays with it downstairs .
*MOT: when hes in his bedroom and were sitting in his rocker he grabs for his books and wants me to read to him .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: are these any of these books um the same as you have at home or similar ?
*EXP: in other words would he recognize any of these ?
*MOT: um we have one thats similar to that fuzzy book .
*MOT: um so .
*MOT: and we have TheFootBook but he thats one of the ones he closes every time I try to read it to him .
*MOT: he has a couple favorites that he wants to read all the time .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: do you remember what those are ?
*MOT: um MooBaaLaLaLa .
*MOT: and the other one is a a book similar to that but its like fuzzy animals .
*MOT: those are the ones he likes to read .
*EXP: it seemed like he liked animals .
*EXP: does he know any animals ?
*MOT: we .
*EXP: does he know the names of them or sounds ?
*MOT: we have um four cats .
*MOT: so he a lot of times he knows cats and he he makes the sound .
*MOT: my mom has a lot of dogs so he knows doggy .
*MOT: and we we do baby sign with him .
*MOT: and he does this for the sign for doggy .
*MOT: and sometimes hell sorta kinda bark .
*EXP: and does he know any like farm animals yet or does he do that stuff yet ?
*MOT: no not .
*MOT: Imean I started to to show him cows and chickens and sheep um on a computer game that I have but hes kinda slightly interested .
*MOT: I think maybe if they were the real thing he might be more interested .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: I wanna eventually take him somewhere where there are animals but I havent gotten to it yet .
*MOT: we went to the zoo when he was really little but that was more for just a moms outing than a babies outing .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*EXP: yeah these experiences kind of change as they get older .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yep .
*EXP: um well what kinds of toys do you think are best for his personality ?
*MOT: well he likes the babydolls a lot .
*MOT: and it seems like he really likes the food toys a lot .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so we might hafta be getting some uh play food pretty soon .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: mhm it seemed like he was playing with several items .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: do you think he recognizes any of these items ?
*MOT: the waffle he .
*MOT: well see we cut it up before we give it to him .
*MOT: so he probably wouldnt necessarily recognize that .
*MOT: same with the bread .
*MOT: we cut it up before we give it to him .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: I give him like grilled cheese sandwiches .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and I give him like cinnamon toast .
*MOT: um the spoon he would recognize .
*MOT: the plate .
*EXP: the pizza ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: spaghetti peas any of those ?
*MOT: peas maybe .
*MOT: he does he throws them usually .
*MOT: um he doesnt really prefer .
*MOT: hes hes really picky with food .
*MOT: I might hafta start trying pizza because he might actually eat pizza .
*MOT: because he likes dif like he likes a lot of different flavors he doesnt like just plain old chicken .
*MOT: he needs to have chicken with spices and stuff in it .
*EXP: thats unusual .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah hes .
*EXP: does he like toys that make noise still ?
*MOT: mhm yep .

*MOT: but he still he likes to close that book too .
*MOT: so but he we have one peekaboo book at home .
*MOT: its like a SesameStreet peekaboo that you lift things up and he seems to be tickled by that .
*EXP: so he really likes the babydolls you said .
*MOT: yeah uh when we go to play group the little girl has babydolls and hes always going after them .
*MOT: that and electronics .
*EXP: its just interesting because most of the kids his age have not dont really go for the babydoll .
*MOT: huh .
*EXP: at all .
*MOT: wow .
*EXP: youre unique .
*MOT: yeah the one the the one baby the the little girl is over a year shes like four thirteen or fourteen months .

*MOT: what are you doing buddy buds ?
*MOT: um the books at this point seem to not interest him as much as all the other toys .
*EXP: mhm .
