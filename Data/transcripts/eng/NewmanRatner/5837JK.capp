*EXP: um Ill get on the floor .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um which toys did she seem most interested in ?
*MOT: well I kinda put her down in the middle and she gravitated toward the books right away um .
*MOT: we we read books a lot at home so that may have been familiar to her .
*MOT: um we dont have as many of these toys at home so this was kind of new .
*MOT: toward the end shes li started chewing on the cheese .
*MOT: um and so that was interesting .
*MOT: and she liked this kangaroo a lot .
*EXP: oh okay .
*EXP: alright uh .
*MOT: but she seemed more interested in it as a toy than as a puppet like when I tried to do the puppet thing .
*EXP: yeah she wasnt .
*MOT: she wasnt feeling it .
*EXP: okay so which would you say she liked the least uh out of these three ?
*EXP: which pile ?
*MOT: oh um probably the well I dunno cause .
*MOT: can I say that she was kind of equally interested I think she was ki .
*EXP: um yeah thats fine .
*MOT: I think she was equally interested in .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: in them .
*EXP: alright um do you have any of these books at home ?
*MOT: um not in particular no we ha we have lots of books like these but not any of these titles .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um I know shes still kind of young but do you think there are any items she um might recognize ?
*EXP: any of the names of ?
*MOT: yeah I definitely dont think she recognizes any of the food items because everything she eats is pureed so were not um were not into that .
*MOT: um book shh we read books a lot and we say the word book a lot so the fact that this is a book she might be picking up on that .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: um but the rest of it I would say no she doesnt recognize it .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um so you say you would say she likes books over toys ?
*EXP: prefers them or ?
*EXP: I dunno .
*MOT: I dunno .
*MOT: yeah I dunno if I would say that she prefers them .
*MOT: I would say she she likes books but she also likes toys .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: she likes both .
*EXP: alright um .
*EXP: do you guys have dolls at home does she play with dolls ?
*MOT: um we dont have very many dolls .
*MOT: um no not at this point .
*MOT: we do have some stuffed animals .
*MOT: um and weve got just lots of like teething r rings and plastic baby toys .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: and for the most part thats what she plays with at home .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um so which toy would you say is best for her um personality ?
*MOT: I would say things she can chew on .
*MOT: I would say the plastic things that she could chew on right now .
*MOT: um yeah were dealing with some teething issues so shes putting everything in her mouth .
*EXP: alright I think thats it .
*EXP: um unless is there anything you can think about about how she plays at home you wanna tell us ?
*EXP: favorite toys or anything ?
*MOT: she goes from one thing to the other as you can see shes pretty mobile so she doesnt stay on one toy or one thing for very long she switches .
*EXP: okay alright uh we are all done then .
*MOT: oops .
*EXP: excuse you .
*EXP: youre very smart .
*EXP: yeah youre like this is over .
*MOT: shes like Im done .
*MOT: so done .
*EXP: wow .
*EXP: um so I think I heard you say so they dont eat icecream or anything ?
*MOT: right .
*MOT: they eat yogurt .
*MOT: but .
*MOT: but no its kinda funny because the food that you have here is not .
*MOT: they eat food but not this food so .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: yeah I get that a lot .
*EXP: a lot of times people I ask people um they se tend to play with the peas .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: and I say oh youknow are they eating that and theyre like Imean they it doesnt look like that .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: youknow when it comes in the ja in the jar and Im always just asking like whether they recognize the name .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: youknow ?
*MOT: right .
*EXP: and stuff because .
*MOT: and I dunno Imean we we have peas and I everytime I give them peas I say peas but do I if I said chicken and gave them peas would they look at me funny I dont think so .
*MOT: I dont think they have that recognition yet .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: thats a good point .
*EXP: thats a good point .
*MOT: theyve certainly heard the word though .
*EXP: and then you play peekaboo with her too and .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: and things like that .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: I know on the questionnaires it talks about pattycake were not doing pattycake yet but .
*EXP: not there yet ?
*MOT: but we do lots of peekaboo and we do lots of hiding and youknow hiding around corners and things like that .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: alright .
*EXP: do you think oh um one question I didnt even ask last time or with Allison was um what do you think is attracting them most to these toys like whether its texture or um noise or ?
*MOT: I think its a combination of things .
*MOT: I definitely think its material with the plastic stuff .
*MOT: this feels like the things at home that they chew on .
*MOT: and so I think they they feel it and they put it in their mouth and theyre teething so that feels good to them .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so I with the plastic stuff I think thats whats going on .
*MOT: um maybe a little bit of color because they definitely she definitely gravitated toward the bright blue plate and the pizza more than some of the duller things .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um with the doll I think its that its new .
*MOT: shes never seen something that looks like this except her live twin .
*MOT: and so at fi like I was really wondering if she thought that this were a real person for a few minutes there .
*MOT: and that youknow she started like sucking on it and like kissing it and moving it over and it didnt respond too much so in the end I think she figured out that it wasnt real but .
*MOT: at the beginning Im not sure quite what she thought about that .
*MOT: um so I think she was attracted to it because its its new and .
*EXP: its interesting .
*MOT: and potentially interactive the way her twin is .
*EXP: thats great .
*EXP: oh yeah shes all over everything .
*MOT: yeah thats the way at home shes keeps me on my toes .
*EXP: alright well I think um thats it .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: you can go ahead you can leave that right there cause that way I dont hafta write everything down the answers to your questions to the questions .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: and she can just continue to xxx or play or whatever shes doing .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: with her spoon .
*EXP: um so first question is have you noticed any differences in what shes interested in playing with or the way shes playing with toys since the last time she was here ?
*MOT: um I think the last the last two times um she showed pretty equal interest in everything and this time she was pretty much ignored pile number three here .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um I kind of think that teething has trumped everything else she went straight for things that looked hard and yummy to chew on .
*MOT: um and she she caught a top tooth yesterday and so I just think .
*EXP: ah .
*MOT: yeah you got some spit on you .
*MOT: um I kinda think that that trumped everything else in in the play session today .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um but she also showed interest in in the frogs so you know its it wasnt to the exclusion of other things .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: did she um was she interested in any of the other animals that you got out for her ?
*MOT: the chicken the frog and the chicken were the two that she showed the most interest in .
*MOT: I you know pointed out some other things but she didnt really going for it she definitely liked this frog .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*EXP: cool .
*EXP: you too .
*EXP: and how what about the hard toys that you said she did like the best ?
*EXP: um did she have certain ones that were favorites today ?
*MOT: the cookies .
*MOT: the two cookies she really liked um .
*MOT: this purple spoon the smaller of the two spoons she liked .
*MOT: um she spent a little bit of time with the sandwich parts um but mostly the cookies and the spoon .
*EXP: and do you think she would um recognize the names of any of these especially like the food items um .
*MOT: I dont know because it looks different .
*MOT: I make I make them sandwiches with cheese and turkey but I cut them up really small so it doesnt look like that and I so Im not Im not sure that she did that .
*MOT: um she doesnt theyre not drinking juices yet so um apple juice is foreign to her .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so probably not right .
*EXP: not at least by the way they look .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: but shes heard you say you know sandwich or turkey or she xxx mhm .
*MOT: uhhuh cheese yeah shes definitely heard those things bread .
*EXP: lets see what else .
*EXP: and she did she look at books today ?
*MOT: um not really I tried to get her interested in this GoodNightMoon one but she didnt really seem like she was interested in it .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: lets see .
*EXP: and .
*EXP: um does how about toys at home does she have stuffed animals does she have a baby doll ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: she doesnt have a we dont have baby dolls um .
*MOT: she does have stuffed lots of stuffed animals and she does have plastic food and um ah .
*EXP: oh she does okay .
*MOT: recent thats recent she got a shopping cart from grandma for christmas and including plastic food .
*MOT: so um so thats a new thing .
*MOT: we have tons of books at home um so shes familiar with some of these things .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: does she have any books like the ones that we have here ?
*MOT: um yeah very similar yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: weve got DoctorSeuss weve got the original GoodNightMoon not this particular one .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: are you making a mess baby ?
*EXP: so the main difference in the way played was the teething thing and so she you feel like she was chewing more ?
*MOT: I think yeah I mean she all she always chews when she comes here but um .
*MOT: but yeah I think that her exclusive interest in pretty much in the food was because of that yeah .
*EXP: because of that alright .
*EXP: I think thats everything I needta ask you um .
*EXP: and Im probably gonna ask you very similar things for Allison .
*MOT: of course yup .
*EXP: because thats the way it works with twins .
*EXP: and Ill go ahead and take it out and turn it off .
*EXP: she can play with this stuff .
*EXP: I was gonna ask you a couple more questions about what you guys played with .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: you wanna play with Devon ?
*EXP: you can show her these all the food .
*MOT: Jordan this is Devon .
*MOT: right here come here this is Devon .
*EXP: thats my friend Devon .
*MOT: say hi Devon .
*MOT: hi Devon .
*EXP: here show Devon all the cupcakes you made and everything .
*EXP: look you think you can make me some juice ?
*EXP: I saw you xxx milk it looked really good .
*EXP: this rooms a little weird to be in Im not Im not usually back here for this .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: okay so can you just tell me about what you guys did ?
*MOT: sure .
*MOT: we um we started off over here with the puzzle .
*MOT: and she dumped all of the pieces out .
*MOT: and then um we worked a little bit on the habitats .
*MOT: and um and she picked different animals didnt quite seem to understand the habitat thing but um .
*MOT: but enjoyed putting the pieces on the puzzles .
*EXP: she seemed to kinda get it like when you were talking about you know .
*MOT: a little bit .
*MOT: and so we farms for um halloween and .
*MOT: and so we were able to see somebody milking a cow and like we were um able to see the pumpkin patches and things like that so .
*MOT: theyve they know understand a little bit .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: um and so yeah we started off playing with that and then she wanted to feed the farmer a pizza and that got us over into the food .
*MOT: um and she played played with the food for a while and we started um .
*MOT: the sushi was a new thing to her so she got the sushi and um I described what that was and .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: that led us into talking about things that are shaped like circles cause weve been working on shapes at home .
*MOT: um so we did that a little bit and she spent most of the rest of the time with the kitchen and food stuff and at the end kind of seemed to wanna start pretending with the things that werent around .
*MOT: the milk that isnt here and but she had a cup so she wanted to pretend that there was milk and find a fridge a pretend fridge somewhere else and she kind of went beyond what was here that toward the end .
*EXP: does she like to do alot of pretend stuff like that at home ?
*MOT: theyre just shes just start she and her sister are both just starting to do the pretending .
*MOT: um yeah that thats really just emerged over their last month .
*MOT: so thats mhm .
*EXP: xxx that was really cute she like and she imitated you doing it too .
*EXP: thats good .
*EXP: did does does she at home does she tend to gravitate more towards the different stuff too um or .
*EXP: like xxx .
*MOT: some yeah I mean she does we have a kitchen at home and she does like playing with the play kitchen um .
*MOT: she also she really likes books .
*MOT: so its kind of a surprise to me that she didnt go for GoodNightMoon at any time cause she knows that book and um shes um really into books alot so its its a surprise to me that she didnt do that .
*MOT: um but yeah she does like playing with the kitchen at home .
*EXP: does she .
*EXP: she pointed at it so I thought she would go for it so I was like huh I thought that was interesting .
*MOT: I thought so too yeah and .
*MOT: but maybe its just cause thats old news cause weve read that book a million times you know so .
*EXP: exactly yeah .
*EXP: and she didnt seem to go for the dolls either which I thought was funny .
*MOT: no no not at all .
*MOT: and even when I said hey are you interested in feeding something to this doll or shes just like no not interested .
*EXP: is she not um as into the dolls as um .
*MOT: as her sister no shes not .
*MOT: um of the two of them Allison is much more into dolls than Jordan is .
*EXP: does she xxx more like xxx and she more likes to kinda cuddle things or .
*MOT: um yeah .
*MOT: Allison is her sister is much um more maternal and you know more gentle and um Jordan is a little bit more rough and tumble .
*MOT: alot of times she doesnt even wanna play with any of the toys she wants to run and wants to have races and be physical and you know shes more more of a kinesthetic kid I think than her sister .
*EXP: shell be a little athlete .
*MOT: so yeah maybe well see .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: I mean they both they both seemed to like alot of stuff we had here .
*MOT: mhm a little bit yeah .
*EXP: so um I then I think she was starting to get into the tools just now .
*EXP: yeah do you have anything like that at home ?
*MOT: we dont have anything like that at home weve got um the cubes that have the different shapes that you fit things in which is a little bit similar to this thing with the holes .
*MOT: but we dont have one of the like play tool set sorts of things we dont have that at home .
*EXP: yeah some I think sometimes theyre like some of the little boys like if I feel like alot of the girls dont go for it as much xxx kinda look at it and then they wanna deal with the cooking or something .
*MOT: mhm right .
*EXP: um yeah she knew her shapes really well .
*EXP: didnt you ?
*MOT: you know your shapes ?
*CHI: yeah xxx .
*MOT: yeah pretty much .
*EXP: I actually feel like I think you guys were talking she even knew like the difference between like the rectangle and the xxx .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: she knows I mean its not with a hundred percent accuracy obviously but shes starting shes starting to know her shapes .
*EXP: I think thats also why like they have they got theyre getting so high too with like the the other test because I think some of the kids weve seen arent really into shapes yet and .
*EXP: and that maybe helps their like visual they seem to have really good .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: oh dont put that in your mouth .
*MOT: these just pretend .
*MOT: dont really eat with it just pretend .
*EXP: yeah they seem to really you know do well with that xxx .
*CHI: mom .
*MOT: mommy will pretend .
*EXP: are there um any other Im trying to think what else .
*MOT: ooh go look at that thats cool .
*CHI: yeah .
*EXP: anything different about like this play session versus the other ones I know the toys are different so .
*MOT: the well there wasnt there wasnt any pretending whatsoever at the other play sessions that was not something they were ready to do .
*MOT: um and I just think there was alot more awareness of what things were at this session just because theyre so much older .
*MOT: I feel like with the with the puzzles um they know they can identify what theyre playing with .
*MOT: and in the other play sessions they were so young that I was doing alot of heres what this object is and trying to tell them and teach them .
*MOT: and now it was you know they they know what these things are so its more playing and so its not just this is a cow but its here the cow says moo the cow lives on a farm the cow is friends with the goat the cow you know you you just expand theyre so much older that you can extend what youre doing .
*EXP: yeah they yeah .
*MOT: um into other learning and not just so be so focused on the vocabulary and more on the concepts that are beyond the vocabulary .
*EXP: yeah they seem to have really mastered the the vocabulary you know and I think theyre ready to .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: you know and this is good you know theyre moving toward like the pretend things and so thats really great yeah .
*MOT: move beyond that right yeah its .
*MOT: its its fun .
*EXP: yeah I know and it will be more fun to play now cause you can do more .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: you can pretend to make food like you just were doing so .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: thats great .
*EXP: um well thats all I hafta ask you about the play session .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: I just have two more consents for you and then .
