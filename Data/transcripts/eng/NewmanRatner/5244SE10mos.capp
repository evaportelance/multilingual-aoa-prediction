*MOT: um probably this one .
*EXP: um why do you think that is ?
*MOT: um well I tried to engage with a few of these and she kind of touched but she kept these things in her hands .
*MOT: the whole time .
*EXP: yeah stuffed animal are probably what she wanted .
*MOT: and she has about a five second maybe two second attention span so books are quite one thing at a time .
*EXP: alright so so what was she most interested in or most interested in the books or the animals would you say ?
*MOT: between those two ?
*MOT: maybe the animals .
*EXP: animals ?
*EXP: uh okay um do you think she would recognize any of the animals we have or the names of them ?
*EXP: the dog or ?
*MOT: I dont think so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um do you guys have any play toys at home or play sets ?
*MOT: I do have some mhm .
*EXP: so what about the foods would she recognize any of those ?
*MOT: um I dont think so .
*MOT: she doesnt eat well even the things we have are like large peaches and onions and things like that so I dont think um stuff like this .
*EXP: okay um we noticed a lot of the babies like to play with the spoons is she is she into those ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: and she plays with dolls ?
*MOT: mhm absolutely yes .
*EXP: well do you have any of the books we have at home ?

*EXP: okay uhhum .
*EXP: what about the doll does she like the doll at all ?
*MOT: yeah she seemed to .
*MOT: and the only doll that we have at home so far is a stuffed animal doll and she hasnt showed a lot of interest so it was interesting to see her responding to the hard eyes and everything every time I put it down she seemed to want it back .
*EXP: okay um which one would you say is the best one for her personality ?
*MOT: that is hard to say .
*MOT: one particular toy ?
*MOT: or like the group of toys okay .
*MOT: well shes I would say probably the plates and spoons .
*MOT: um shes very interactive and likes things that make noise so just the sound of them and uh .

*EXP: okay I think thats it is there anything else um what she plays with at home favorite toys or anything ?
*MOT: hard to keep the two of them straight .
*MOT: Sala what do you play with at home ?
*MOT: just baby interactive toys I mean she always goes for those .
