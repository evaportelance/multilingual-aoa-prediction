*MOT: that was new for her .
*MOT: she really likes books .
*MOT: she has alot of books at home she loves to just turn the pages um .
*MOT: see shes going after the baby again .
*MOT: and then she likes um she liked this thing .
*MOT: like the fur .
*MOT: she plays with she has a couple things at home that have a little fur .
*MOT: shes like she likes the baby .
*MOT: yeah and I guess the things that made noise like the keys and this thing .
*EXP: how would with regards to the baby what do you think that she liked about the baby ?
*MOT: she does that when shes trying to show off and get your attention shell go sideways I dont know why .
*MOT: I think because its the same size at her .
*MOT: because she has a couple stuffed animals and shes more interested in the ones that are the bigger ones that are about her size .
*MOT: I think the face .
*MOT: like the eyes I think shes in tune with .
*MOT: and I dont know maybe this one .
*MOT: because it looks like her and I think because it makes noise .
*MOT: its head makes noise .
*MOT: its like a rattle but .
*EXP: uhuh .
*MOT: maybe thats disgusting she likes to kiss it .
*EXP: its okay yeah we we clean the toys its fine yeah .
*MOT: okay .

*MOT: just like made it talk to her .

*MOT: she didnt seem to care she came over and gave it a kiss so .
*EXP: thats nice .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: uh yeah .
*MOT: I think maybe we should get her a babydoll .
*EXP: what do you think about the um the books ?
*EXP: do you have similar books at home ?
*MOT: the books that are her favorite at home are the one that have um the touchy feely things in them um .
*MOT: she likes those the best .
*MOT: um because she likes to run her hand down the page and try to figure out like where it is .
*MOT: and plus I think it makes them easier to turn .
*MOT: because theyre kinda halfway open so she can turn the pages really easy .
*MOT: um so I think those are her favorite um .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I guess maybe the colors .
*MOT: but she wasnt youknow she liked this one but not really the other ones so .
*EXP: what kind of textures do you think she likes the most .
*MOT: she likes the fur .
*MOT: because she I guess thats her fine motor skills working on that um .
*MOT: yeah she likes the fur I think .
*MOT: and then this one doesnt have any .
*MOT: but at home we have ones that have like uh like bumps .
*MOT: or like uh like velcro youknow like the scratchy part of the velcro she loves those .
*EXP: interesting .
*MOT: yeah I dont know why I guess because its real easy for her to feel .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so she likes those .
*EXP: and um .
*EXP: I think you played were you playing uh peekaboo or was that .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: I dont think so .
*MOT: she likes to play peekaboo and actually she um shell play peekaboo with herself .
*MOT: so shell take a cover up over her head and then pull it off .
*EXP: aw .
*MOT: and shell do it as long as youre if you keep saying wheres Ava wheres Ava ?
*MOT: oh there she is .
*MOT: then shell do it .
*MOT: so yeah she plays she likes peekaboo alot .
*EXP: thats cute .
*MOT: one of her favorite games .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: and then this book happened to be um about animals .
*EXP: do you think she youve been over certain names of animals with her or .
*MOT: well we have a cat and she knows the word for cat like if I .
*MOT: normally if I say it .
*MOT: shell start like looking around and trying to find the cat .
*MOT: so um .

*MOT: but yeah so she really likes the cat .
*MOT: thats the one that she cat and parrot too .

*EXP: what um were there any other animals stuffed animals that you played with ?
*MOT: um this one oh she played with this guy she liked this .
*MOT: stuff .

*MOT: yeah she likes that part .
*EXP: yeah she can pull it and .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: its kinda like sticky .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and um a couple of her animals have like little fur like stuff theyre not sticky like this but um .
*MOT: little strings for their tails .
*MOT: and shell sit there and just like pull on them for youknow keep her entertained for about five minutes which .
*MOT: in her day thats a long time so .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: do you think shed recognize the name for bee ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: no she only knows um .
*MOT: I think like three words .
*MOT: maybe four she knows up .
*MOT: and she knows cat .
*MOT: and I think mama and kissy .
*EXP: I noticed you had um she was running over to the camera and so you were giving her uh youknow you said some no and she stopped .
*MOT: oh yeah she does know no .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: and then during the play you were saying good job and was wondering if you felt like because I noticed she understood the no and I was just wondering .
*MOT: um she does I think she understands praise for sure .
*MOT: um because thats how we got her to like if we say give mommy kissy shell give you a kiss um and then we made like such a big deal out of it .
*MOT: and so now she does it for the praise I think .
*MOT: right now were working on highfive and uh .
*MOT: so shell do that .
*MOT: um but I think she does know when youre like good job good job and she gets excited so .
*EXP: um and what about any of the play food ?
*EXP: did she .
*MOT: um she .
*MOT: doesnt really well she was interested in the spaghetti for some real she doesnt eat any finger foods at all she only has purees so .
*MOT: she doesnt know what any of it is .
*MOT: and she doesnt drink out of a juice cup either so the juice I think was interesting because it moved but um .
*MOT: she doesnt know what is .
*MOT: and then she played with the pizza but .
*MOT: I dont think shes ever seen pizza before .
*MOT: I think it was just the colors .
*MOT: the contrast on there .
*EXP: that makes sense .
*MOT: so and plus its kindof squishy .
*EXP: so theres not really anything that she that you may have used the name of at home or something that shed be familiar with or even .
*MOT: mhm mhm no .
*MOT: she nope .
*MOT: nope not even .
*MOT: n Imean she doesnt even drink a bottle so um .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so yeah she doesnt really .
*MOT: not yet .
*EXP: what do you think she was least interested in ?
*EXP: today .
*MOT: um probably the food .
*MOT: and then I mean she didnt really pay attention to this that much .
*MOT: I dont expect her to know what a clock is .
*MOT: um and Imean then particular stuffed animals I guess .
*MOT: like these arent necessarily as brightly colored so .
*MOT: she didnt really go for those and like .
*MOT: she didnt look at um any of these books she has this book but she doesnt look at it .
*MOT: she didnt really play with any of this stuff .
*MOT: um yeah .
*MOT: and now shes playing with the pizza again .
*MOT: and the spaghetti .
*EXP: but you did so do you have um stuffed animals at home ?
*MOT: we have some .
*MOT: we have some stuffed animals .
*MOT: and she plays with those .
*MOT: she like I said she plays with alot of books .
*MOT: she spends the majority of her time on the floor .
*MOT: um like .
*MOT: she doesnt go in her bouncer she doesnt go in a swing .
*MOT: she doesnt I dont carry her in a sling .
*MOT: she we have an Exersaucer .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: she hates it .
*MOT: doesnt wanna be in it .
*MOT: so um .
*MOT: she spends most of her time crawling around or um .
*MOT: she can pull up on things and so she just likes to .
*MOT: youknow crawl and over to like couch and pull up on the couch and sometimes Ill like spread toys out on the couch and she plays with them um .
*MOT: and then she has alot of little like I dont know like FisherPrice like little activity things that shell play with .
*MOT: and those will keep her entertained but .
*MOT: yeah shes not really into all the automated kindof like swings and stuff so um .
*MOT: she spends most of her time just kindof hanging out on the floor crawling around and chasing the cat and and stuff so .
*EXP: sounds like she just likes to be free .
*MOT: she does .
*MOT: she doesnt like to be confined .
*MOT: um she does like to go in her stroller thats the one thing um .
*MOT: she likes to go on walks .
*MOT: she likes to be outside um .
*MOT: so we try to spend atleast an hour or two outside .
*MOT: just like walking around and looking at stuff so .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: she doesnt like to be if were inside um all day .
*MOT: or we dont go anywhere that day she gets really like ornery .
*MOT: like she wants to go somewhere just .
*MOT: doesnt matter where like Target the mall she doesnt care just doesnt wanna be home all the time so .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: well thats nice .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: thats nice youre social .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: um well I guess I think I just had uh one question about the stuffed animals because it seems like she tends to play with toys .
*EXP: and that seemed to be something she liked here today .
*EXP: and thats if because you had gone I feel like you played with alot of stuffed animals .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um does she have any did you find any in particular that she liked or did you feel that it was better to kindof go through them all ?
*MOT: um well we didnt go through them all .
*MOT: Imean we looked at this one because it has sparkles she likes things that are sparkly .
*MOT: she likes that guy .
*MOT: and then she liked this fur .
*MOT: uhuh .
*MOT: its not my puppy .

*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: she may recognize that .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: um but yeah she likes stuffed animals and like I said um we have a our parrot is a puppet and she really likes that so we played with this .
*MOT: she um has a really short attention span so .
*MOT: Imean Im sure all babies do but she doesnt like concentrate on something for very long .
*MOT: so um thats why we went through alot of them .
*MOT: alot of toys keeping her happy .
*EXP: do you feel like she played similarly here as she does at home ?
*MOT: um I think she wasnt frustrated here because sometimes at home I think she gets bored or frustrated with like the same toys so um .
*MOT: these were newer so I think they held enter her attention span longer .
*MOT: which is good .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: well good .
*MOT: so .
