*MOT: hello mister clock .
*EXP: guess I can ask you some questions now .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: since youve been playing for a while .
*EXP: I wasnt really looking at him too much .
*EXP: so Im not sure what he liked best .
*EXP: um out of these .
*EXP: but these look more spread out than these so thats what Im guessing .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I think definitely um he went for the clock again and the food stuff .
*EXP: and the food .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: excuse me .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: specifically these peas .
*MOT: I dont know why .
*EXP: especially those ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: did he like anything else um foodwise ?
*MOT: he liked this .
*MOT: was it th this one or the red one ?
*MOT: was more um .
*EXP: this one .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and then I dont know if it was color choice or not but .
*MOT: and then he liked this cookie once I showed it to him .
*MOT: but he hasnt really had cookies yet Imean I just think maybe the multiple colors .
*EXP: the colors mhm .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: the measuring spoons he liked the way that jingled .
*MOT: didnt I tried to get him interested in the stuffed animals to see .
*MOT: and he didnt show any interest really .
*EXP: I thought you were doing the rooster I thought he would like that .
*MOT: but he didnt show too um .
*MOT: he didnt seem to .
*EXP: not really .
*MOT: didnt spark anything with him this time .
*EXP: looks like hes found it again .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: he really likes that .
*MOT: yeah and I Imean I havent looked for anything similar to that but .
*EXP: I remember last time he liked that right .
*MOT: he did .
*MOT: and then when we asked him youknow when I said .
*MOT: wheres the clock ?
*MOT: h h he went toward it .
*MOT: but this time he didnt seem to really register the way it did the first time .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: was that the main thing that he liked last time ?
*EXP: Im trying to remember .
*MOT: yes yes .
*MOT: he just stayed with that for the longest time .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and now hes found .
*EXP: oh look it hes trying a lot of things huh ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and he likes to just pick things up and throw them to see how they sound when they land like that .
*MOT: youknow these things are heavier .
*MOT: and I could see that he was like .
*MOT: huh ?
*EXP: right .
*MOT: that made a different thud instead of the the peas that were so light .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*EXP: so do you think he likes them for that reason ?
*EXP: so ju different things theyre different weights and they sound different ?
*MOT: I think thats what he likes to experiment with is yeah .
*MOT: just seeing how they .
*EXP: what gravity does huh ?
*MOT: like what happens when I do this right ?
*EXP: yeah your little science xxx .
*MOT: haha .
*EXP: did he try any of the books today ?
*MOT: he didnt .
*MOT: I got the peekababy out .
*MOT: and he didnt seem to even recognize what I was trying to read .
*EXP: okay okay .
*EXP: oh I know you tried with .
*MOT: I tried the kangaroo .
*EXP: kangaroo .
*EXP: thats it .
*MOT: and the chicken or rooster .
*EXP: no interest there .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: he didnt like pitcher until I put something in there .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: it made a sound .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: made a sound ?
*MOT: that was .
*EXP: so he didnt .
*MOT: that was that that he liked .
*MOT: and but he youknow when he got it out then he didnt want the pitcher anymore .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: he didnt wanna try to put it back in like .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: sometimes he might .
*EXP: balance out huh ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: it does .
*EXP: you found the clock again I know .
*EXP: um lets see .
*EXP: if or at home maybe um if youre reading a book with him .
*EXP: would he rather turn the pages himself or does he like you to to sort of do that ?
*MOT: he wants to hold the book .
*EXP: he wants to hold it okay .
*CHI: right .
*MOT: what I found yesterday was that the best thing was for him to be in his highchair haha .
*MOT: to try to read because otherwise hes grabbing it .
*MOT: and depending on youknow these pages books are fine but the thinner ones he would just be tearing at this point so .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but he wants to be .
*EXP: he wants to be in control of that .
*MOT: exactly .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*EXP: and would you say he likes toys better at this point than books .
*MOT: definitely mhm .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um does he play with any dolls at home ?
*MOT: he hasnt .
*MOT: and my daughter has a lot .
*MOT: but he hasnt hes gone toward her favorite doll a few times but I think its only because she plays with it so much .
*MOT: I dont really think .
*EXP: its not so so much that its a doll .
*MOT: right I mean all the out of all these dolls he didnt go for that .
*MOT: he wanted to play with this dolls eyes a little bit .
*MOT: and touch the mouth and the nose .
*MOT: but I dont think he was really .
*MOT: I dont I dont think dolls are his interest area now .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um so would you say that I know its not the food toys but the animals or the books interested him the least this visit ?
*EXP: which one was sort of least interesting ?
*MOT: um I would say the books would be the least interesting this time .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: Imean it seemed like I sparked a little bit of interest with the puppet and the r chicken but not .
*MOT: and the books Imean I may as well have not been saying anything .
*MOT: didnt seem to do anything with those .
*MOT: and which kinds of toys do you think are good for his personality ?
*MOT: the stuff that has an effect like when hes shaking the the um teaspoons or the measuring spoons .
*MOT: he can hear a reaction .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so um at home theres a little play piano .
*MOT: so he likes to po Imean hes not playing it .
*MOT: but he likes to pound on it because he knows that it makes a sound .
*MOT: um I dont know .
*EXP: does he have any of those toys that um you push a button and something pops up .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: he like he likes those .
*MOT: he likes things theres a .
*EXP: so cause and effect ?
*MOT: cause and effect kinda thing .
*MOT: where hes you press a button and plays music .
*MOT: or I cant rememb its something that you can hang on the side of a crib .
*MOT: but we dont use it for that .
*MOT: um but theres a little um dial that you can turn .
*MOT: and like these two gears turn .
*MOT: so he likes to see that happen .
*MOT: um yeah push and pull kinda stuff .
*MOT: anything that he can hit to make a sound or .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: fair enough huh ?
*MOT: yeah and the kitchen my ah our play kitchens in the basement .
*MOT: but he would be all over this stuff too if he could just .
*MOT: whatever he can shake and .
*EXP: whatevers making noise .
*MOT: move or press buttons .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: does he xxx ?
*MOT: pounds things together all the time .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: because he was trying to do that with something there .
*EXP: um and it didnt make much of a noise .
*MOT: I think it was the two peas .
*MOT: it was like the peas and something .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: and it didnt really didnt really do anything for him because it didnt make a noise .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: right so you s you skipped that and went on to something else huh ?
*MOT: do you think he recognizes the names or any of the like food items or the utensils or any of the animal names yet ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: no um youknow I filled out that form and I said youknow I dont know if hes sposta know any of this stuff but he doesnt .
*MOT: Imean we .
*EXP: no no theres no theyre so variable at this age their interests what um .
*EXP: theres nothing that hes sposta be doing that we have here .
*EXP: its just sort of looking at what he wants .
*MOT: of interest .
*MOT: yeah I I cant say that like last time we we che we said like .
*MOT: Lucas find the clock .
*MOT: he didnt um Imean he went for it xxx and that totally surprised me .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: because he seemed to know the name of it then .
*MOT: but yeah .
*MOT: and I think there are random things .
*MOT: like I think he knows milk now but not any of the .
*MOT: I I dont think I could say to him youknow .
*MOT: get the book .
*MOT: or get the .
*EXP: if you um I think the reason we may be asking that is just that if he did know some of the names and you said the name would he be more likely to go get that than if he didnt recognize any of those names and was just playing so youknow .
*MOT: no no sweetie .
*EXP: thats it its just interesting to look at patterns that way .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: he likes chords .
