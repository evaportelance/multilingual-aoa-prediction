*MOT: shes she likes vegetables a lot .
*MOT: so yeah she likes vegetables and she does not like fruit .
*MOT: so her brothers the opposite he always .
*MOT: its we have one one kid who were always trying to get to eat more fruit and one were getting trying to get to eat more vegetables so .
*MOT: youknow .
*MOT: but shes always liked vegetables a lot .
*MOT: so peas and beans she was happy with .
*EXP: do you have play food at home ?
*MOT: we do .
*MOT: we do mhm so .
*MOT: play food and pot little pots and stuff and theres a little kitchen so .
*EXP: um does she have a sweet tooth ?
*MOT: she does .
*MOT: she does .
*MOT: um but she didnt really the the pie she thought was a waffle though .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: and she didnt see the cookie this time but she was very interested in it earlier when you were showing the cookie with some of the other stuff so .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: she does like cookies a lot .
*MOT: but we dont have pie very often at our house so that might be why she didnt even .
*MOT: she did like cupcakes .
*EXP: were there any foods that you showed her that you think shes probably not familiar with ?
*MOT: um I dont know if I showed her well no the ki I didnt show her I we she looked at this one .
*MOT: shed never probably seen this before .
*MOT: the kiwi .
*MOT: and she probably wouldnt shes seen these rarely .
*MOT: mushroo shes probably seen them a couple times at our house but by the time they get to the dinner table they dont look like this .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: I know all about that .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: um most of the things I think most of the things she wouldve seen at our house .
*MOT: somewhere or the other so .
*EXP: she seemed to be interested in the dolls .
*MOT: she does .
*MOT: she does .
*MOT: she likes her baby dolls a lot .
*MOT: so um but she doesnt shes she actually just got a couple of new ones because it was her birthday and then a neighbor gave us some .
*MOT: excuse me .
*MOT: um but she doesnt usually try to dress them up very often .
*MOT: so she usually just um she actually likes to take all the clothes off of them most of the time .
*MOT: and occasionally if she wants them dressed she comes and is like mom help and shell have me try to put on whatever it is .
*MOT: but she usually tries to get all the clothes off of the baby dolls .
*MOT: and then she does other stuff with them like she likes to push them in a stroller or she has a little doll carrier to put them in .
*MOT: or shell give them bottles like she does other stuff but she doesnt like getting them dressed .
*MOT: so I .
*EXP: she seemed particularly interested in the feet .
*MOT: yeah I don I dont well she does like shoes a lot so .
*MOT: we always have laughed because shes liked shoes since she was really little .
*MOT: and my husbands always like ah shes such a girl .
*MOT: its like I dunno .
*MOT: she likes shoes more than I do so .
*EXP: is there anything you thought shed be interested in that she wasnt and you were surprised ?
*MOT: um I dunno .
*MOT: I thought she might like the puzzle a little bit more but I think she was just she likes the other stuff so um .
*EXP: it seemed like she looked at a lot of things .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: there was a lot of things she was really interested in .
*MOT: so um .
*MOT: I guess at our house we have were ve my husband and I are very um organized people for the most part .
*MOT: hes a engineer and I useta work for I wasnt an engineer but I worked for engineering companies so both of us tend to be very organized .
*MOT: so all of our toys at home are like theres a bin of animals theres a bin of trains theres a bin of doll things .
*MOT: so everythings in its own space so she doesnt usually get like a whole array of um intermixed toys um to look at .
*MOT: usually if shes playing animals then we say when youre done with the animals you pick up the animals and put them away and then you can move on to something else so .
*MOT: um we try to get .
*MOT: it doesnt work all that often but sometimes it does .
*MOT: we try to get her and my son to learn to pick up um what they finish with cause I get tired of picking up toys all all the time .
*MOT: so um we keep we always try to get them to pick pick up their toys and if theres a bin its easier for them they just okay all the dolls go in there all the animals go in there and then its done and it gets put off to the side till they can play with something else .
*MOT: so they dont usually get a whole array of a mix of toys .
*MOT: unless the house is really messy .
*EXP: so this is unusual for her .
*MOT: this is unusual for her to have this arrangement of toys .
*MOT: um the toys themselves .
*MOT: but yeah even like in our house our food toys are in our in our basement .
*MOT: um we have like a a finished basement she has all her food toys are downstairs but her dolls are upstairs .
*MOT: um she has a couple of things like a couple of small things that came with the baby dolls like uh spoons and bowls and some baby food jars and bottles that stay with the baby dolls but the actual food stuff is downstairs and the dolls are upstairs .
*MOT: um and like theyre in her room and a lot of the animals are either in my sons room or out in the general area .
*MOT: so none of these toys are in the same place in our house .
*MOT: so shes just she was very excited .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: just one more question .
*MOT: sure .
*EXP: um have you how have you noticed her play changing since the last time you came in ?
*MOT: um lets see .
*MOT: how old was was it eighteen months ?
*EXP: eighteen months .
*MOT: lets see um .
*EXP: its a ways back .
*MOT: yeah I know Im trying to to think like what was she doing then ?
*MOT: um probably one big thing Ive noticed is she is she started doing um more of the make up play .
*MOT: like if she would take like like two of these animals and say like this one goes that goes there and she would bring this one and he goes next to it and she might bring up another one and stick it like they pretend theyre talking .
*MOT: so shes starting to do more of imaginative play with whatever toy whether its this or my sons cars or whatever .
*MOT: youknow shes starting to um do that kind of play .
*MOT: youknow it useta be just shed pick it up and look at it and might talk to it but not actually have the toys interact .
*MOT: so so she is doing that now .
*MOT: um and I dunno .
*MOT: baby dolls shes probably shes liked her baby dolls since she was about a year .
*MOT: but she probably shes a little more possessive about her baby dolls now .
*MOT: um she gets a little bit more attached to them if somebody tries to take one she gets more um attached like shes the mommy and thats her baby and you dont take the baby from the mommy .
*MOT: so she does that .
*MOT: um and I dunno I think shes doing a little more imitation of me lately .
*MOT: um youknow I notice things like even in the car how shes trying to get into her carseat and things like .
*MOT: I noticed um just the way cause I noticed she was trying to sit with her buckles the way that I sit with my seatbelt on .
*MOT: and I was like hm youre really watching .
*MOT: so xxx but I think I noticed at the house she tries I think shes trying to do a little bit more I think shes trying to copy me a little bit more .
*MOT: it useta be I think shed copy she copied her brother a lot .
*MOT: and she still does .
*MOT: and um she would copy dad also but I think shes starting to realize that mom does some things and dad and brother do other things and shes starting to copy more of what mom does .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: and my son kinda did the same thing I think when he was he copy started at some point copying more of dad .
*MOT: but see if that carries on or not .
*EXP: okay so that is the end of the study .
*MOT: wow .
*EXP: yep .
