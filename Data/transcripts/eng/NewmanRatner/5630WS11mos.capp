*EXP: thats fine I can xxx .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: yeah well we mostly stuck to the food .
*EXP: what did he seem to like the best ?
*EXP: any particular items ?
*MOT: so lets see .
*MOT: we played a lot with the cookies and then he really liked the canned soup kind of using them like a drum .
*MOT: so we did that for a long time .
*MOT: and we only went to the book at the very end when he started crawling away .
*MOT: he didnt do the puppets at all .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: which I think has been true for all of all of his visits .
*EXP: did he play differently than xxx .
*MOT: I dont remember .
*MOT: I think last time he did play with these things that you can tap together but I think he played with like peas and maybe pasta .
*MOT: I think we got the parfait out at one point .
*EXP: and I know that xxx .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: we start he started he went to the cookies first like as soon as we came in here .
*MOT: he had the cookies for a while .
*EXP: do you think xxx .
*MOT: yeah because he was putting them in his mouth spontaneously .
*MOT: I dont think I modeled that for him .
*MOT: Im I think I modeled putting the pizza in my mouth but then he was putting the cookies in his mouth over and over again Im pre I know Im he knows the word cookie so .
*MOT: yeah well so he put the cups to his mouth and the bottle that was pretty .
*MOT: although he started out with the bottle on the wrong side .
*MOT: we dont ever use drink a from a bottle so um he figured out how to do it later .
*MOT: and then he put the soup in his mouth even though thats not really appropriate .
*MOT: I think he put the pizza in his mouth maybe .
*MOT: he didnt put the icecream he picked the icecream up at one point I dont think he stuck that in his mouth I think he put the waffles in his mouth .
*MOT: but I might have modeled that .
*EXP: ahhah xxx .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but he um yeah he didnt put the bread in his mouth .
*MOT: he used the bread as like more like a drum .
*EXP: but he doesnt xxx .
*MOT: he eats bread and he loves pancakes .
*MOT: he ate .
*MOT: thats right yes .
*MOT: are you thirsty ?
*MOT: so I think waffles are the closest thing as that and I said something about theyre like pancakes .
*MOT: um and he eats like crusts like pizza crusts so he should recognize that um .
*MOT: and cookies .
*MOT: and peas .
*MOT: we eat peas .
*MOT: um and his brother eats icecream so he might know that word .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: just from like it sort of being talked about .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: so and that happens when theres another sibling xxx .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: xxx words that his brother xxx .
*MOT: he definitely knows the word cookie .
*MOT: um Im pretty sure he knows the word bread and peas .
*MOT: he probably knows the word pizza .
*MOT: we eat it a lot .
*MOT: um maybe he doesnt know the word bread .
*MOT: it might be toast .
*MOT: um yeah ?
*MOT: is it toast ?
*MOT: right at the end yeah .
*MOT: he played with the baby a little bit .
*MOT: I brought it over .
*MOT: so he didnt spontaneously go to the baby .
*MOT: but he was like he made some vocalizations like talking to the baby and then kissing the baby a lot and then gave the baby sort of xxx the bottle in the general direction of the baby .
*EXP: xxx really interesting .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: xxx does he have a baby doll at home to play with ?
*MOT: youknow um we just have two boys so um Liam got one for christmas and then Liam has started a little bit with like at the um playgroup to like play with the babies and dolls and like push them around in the strollers and stuff .
*MOT: so we got one at christmas so theres one in the house that is more Liams than his .
*MOT: um he could like play with it but he hasnt really like we just got it at christmas .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: you are a nice guy .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: does he like books at home ?
*MOT: yes we read a lot of books .
*EXP: does he like to turn the pages himself or does he like you to do it ?
*MOT: he likes to turn the pages himself .
*EXP: is this uh xxx at home or is it different ?
*MOT: uh its probably about the same .
*MOT: he like plays with one thing for a while and then he moves on to something else .
*MOT: hey buddy .
*EXP: I think that might be all that I needta ask you .
*EXP: if theres any thing else I didnt ask you that you think would be good for us to know about how he plays with the different toys or what his interests are at this point .
*MOT: his interests which I think is the same as before are pretty much whatever his brothers into .
*MOT: so we play a lot more with like cars and trucks and planes and trains and transportation stuff and balls and um puzzles .
*MOT: although he doesnt really like do puzzles but he sort of like plays with the puzzle pieces and stuff so thats more what we play with at home .
*MOT: we have a bunch of stuffed animals but we dont really play with them .
*MOT: and um we have a bunch of books not these books but other books um .
*MOT: but he likes to read .
*MOT: yeah you all ready to go ?
*MOT: all done ?
