*EXP: you have a book .
*EXP: youre good with that book .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um I know you were just here recently .
*EXP: but I wanted to just ask if there have been any chances that you noticed in her interests in terms of what she wanted to play with today .
*EXP: compared to last time ?
*MOT: seemed like at first she was just the bottle and the sippycup and the baby .
*MOT: I dont know if thats because shes getting hungry .
*MOT: and she associated the bottle with herself but .
*MOT: um she seemed more interested this time in the baby .
*MOT: um this is what really had her going last time .
*MOT: texture has been a real big thing lately .
*MOT: is that a sippycup ?
*MOT: oh thank you .
*MOT: um different this time ?
*MOT: didnt seem as much into animals this time .
*MOT: no thats not for the baby .
*MOT: thats for this baby .
*MOT: see ?
*MOT: anything that pretty much bangs .
*MOT: she seems like she really just likes to make noise .
*MOT: and she definitely imitates more .
*MOT: Ive noticed even the last couple of weeks .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: anything that I do she tends to wanna do it too .
*MOT: like when I was doing this .
*MOT: then she wanted to put something in it too .
*MOT: so she definitely likes to imitate .
*MOT: more than she has lately haha .
*EXP: so thats a new thing .
*MOT: yeah she was kinda xxx different things this time .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: um but again the b this b we have a book very similar .
*MOT: and she loves opening the flaps .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so I think a lot of things today she was picking up things she does at home .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: such as the baby doll .
*MOT: the bottle .
*MOT: the sippycup .
*MOT: this book .
*EXP: so she does have a baby doll at home ?
*MOT: she d Imean obviously not like its a little bit smaller .
*MOT: but she has a baby doll at home that she puts in her in the cradle .
*MOT: she kindof tends rocking it and .
*EXP: does she feed that baby doll also ?
*MOT: she tries to with her with her bottle at home yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um does she play with pretend food at home ?
*MOT: um not as much no .
*MOT: so I dont know if its just something different something new that she just .
*EXP: I didnt notice did she play with any of the food items or kitchen items today much ?
*MOT: yeah Imean she was j Imean just kindof more the banging part of it .
*MOT: more so than j really I like putting it in something .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: she was putting them in here .
*MOT: but um was just kindof all different things today right Megan ?
*EXP: do you think she would recognize any of the food um from the last time or from home ?
*EXP: any of the food items ?
*MOT: um not as much .
*MOT: Imean because we dont really have any actually any food items at home .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so I dont xxx just maybe from last time just from playing with them and banging them .
*MOT: but we do Imean we dont have any of these same foods .
*EXP: any of these .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: fake food items .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: do you think she would recognize any of these um comp youknow as real food items ?
*EXP: I know peas dont really come like this .
*EXP: but they look a little like this .
*MOT: she still really .
*MOT: she has kindof food aversions .
*MOT: shes really only eating mainly baby food .
*MOT: so I dont know if shed really recognize .
*EXP: she would recognize these okay .
*EXP: shes a little young for that .
*MOT: yeah maybe like the cookies just from holding trying to youknow take bites of baby cookies but .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: I think this she definitely recognized from last time haha .
*EXP: unique .
*MOT: she likes the hair texture .
*EXP: which of the toys do you think or which toy is good for her her personality ?
*MOT: no no no no no .
*MOT: um shes pretty active .
*MOT: so I think anything that she likes to make youknow do the noises and haha hold things .
*MOT: shes pretty active pretty ah personable baby .
*MOT: so I think doing things that make youknow sound and effect or .
*MOT: making people look at her haha .
*MOT: like doing that .
*MOT: which is maybe why the animals she doesnt really have as much of an interest .
*EXP: I see they dont do .
*MOT: its pretty much of her like sleeping thing at home .
*MOT: she sleeps with an animal but .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: thats really the only time she really plays with stuffed animals .
*EXP: do you think she prefers books or toys ?
*MOT: um during the day Id say probably toys .
*MOT: Imean shes at daycare all week .
*MOT: its mainly youknow toys .
*MOT: that theyre kindof playing with .
*MOT: although th this book she seems very fascinated by the flaps but .
*MOT: we do read the books at night and so .
*MOT: but I think during the day she mainly is with toys .
*MOT: haha Megan .
*EXP: which of these toys do you think interests her the least ?
*MOT: um well other than this Id say all the stuffed animals .
*MOT: I think when I put them in front of her she didnt really seem to go for them .
*EXP: lets see .
*MOT: you like this one though huh ?
*MOT: you like that hair tickle your tummy ?
*EXP: which which of these books do you think she would most wanna look at with you ?
*MOT: um xxx the peekababy .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: just because shes involved in it .
*MOT: and she can do something also .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: okay I think thats it .
*EXP: do you have anything else that you think we should know about that I didnt asked you ?
*MOT: not that I can think offhand .
*MOT: Im surprised she actually sat here .
*MOT: and now shes so mobile crawling around .
*EXP: she did .
*MOT: she does a lot of the crawling all over the place at home .
*MOT: so Im surprised she sat here for the .
*MOT: so she was definitely interested .
*MOT: I think maybe because it was something different .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: Imean thats why she sat so much longer than at home .
*MOT: its the same old toys .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so I think she gets more bored easily .
*EXP: she did sit the whole time .
*EXP: oops .
*MOT: yeah shes usually crawling on everything .
*MOT: all over the room so .
*MOT: haha is that fun ?
*MOT: you like that hair .
*EXP: that is fun isnt it ?
*MOT: that seems to be your favorite toy right now .
