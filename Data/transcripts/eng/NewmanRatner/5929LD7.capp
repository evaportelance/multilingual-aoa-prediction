*MOT: huh ?
*MOT: okay .

*MOT: go play .
*EXP: so what do you think he liked playing with the most ?
*MOT: these animals .
*MOT: we dont have these at home .
*MOT: we dont have any of those stuffed animals .
*MOT: so I think those were completely different for him .
*MOT: he does have uh keys that he carries ar that he uses all the time .
*MOT: so he did like these too .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: or his other ones .
*EXP: those were his two favorite things ?
*MOT: I think so .
*MOT: yeah and we dont have any of these these plastic foods .
*MOT: so I think that was interesting .
*MOT: but uh we do have a lot of books .
*MOT: but he didnt seem that interested in them here .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um with regards to the animals were um were some of the names familiar to him ?
*EXP: like from books or ?
*MOT: um definitely the dog and like a .
*MOT: yeah and the fox would be the two that I think were familiar .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so the other ones I would not so much .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: Which ones do you think were like really uncommon for him ?
*MOT: um in terms of the names like the zebra and the frog .
*MOT: oh goodness .
*MOT: WinnieThePooh we havent done .
*EXP: one second .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: Ill be out soon .
*EXP: no .
*EXP: its okay .
*EXP: anticipating .
*MOT: that .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: sorry about that .
*MOT: thats okay .
*MOT: um so definitely like the dog and the fox I know we have stories about .
*MOT: and .
*MOT: but like WinnieThePooh hes not familiar with .
*MOT: um and nothing anything with xxx .
*MOT: so most of the other ones xxx .
*EXP: xxx yeah .
*MOT: uhoh .
*EXP: because Im not writing anything down .
*EXP: something happened to the .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: was it like a .
*MOT: Ill get up and then see if xxx .
*EXP: oh there it is .
*MOT: there it is .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: oh .
*EXP: yeah yeah yeah just .
*EXP: so how do you play with the how did you play with the animals today ?
*EXP: did you think that he liked it ?
*MOT: well today what I I only did was I just like put them infront of him and named them .
*MOT: um I think other ways I could have done it is to kind of get go on this side and use different voices to play with him .
*MOT: and I didnt do that .
*MOT: um but that would be something else that I could do too .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and then the food .
*EXP: do you think it was was there where there any names or colors or looks that look were familiar to him ?
*EXP: do you think ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: not yet .
*MOT: I dont .
*MOT: he doesnt really eat anything like this yet .
*MOT: um I think he was attracted to the like the he really liked the icecream cone and the peas .
*MOT: those are the his two favorites .
*MOT: um and hes eaten peas .
*MOT: but they dont look like that when he eats them .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: and he hasnt had icecream yet .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: how did you play with the food ?
*EXP: did you try .
*EXP: how did you play with it ?
*MOT: um it was kind of the same thing .
*MOT: just kind of putting it infront of him and naming it .
*MOT: and then trying to build things .
*MOT: so I guess showing him how you would use the food in real life .
*MOT: um but you cant .
*MOT: I would have a more difficult time I guess getting creative with that than I would with the animals .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: I can see that .
*EXP: did you like build meals and things ?
*MOT: I tried to .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: they werent necessarily meals youd eat together .
*MOT: like waffles and peas you wouldnt put together .
*MOT: but trying to put stuff together .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: was he at all interested in the baby doll ?
*MOT: he was interested in looking at it .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and he smiled at it .
*MOT: so um and we dont have any dolls at home either .
*MOT: so um I think he he was yeah he was just interested in looking at the face .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but he wasnt interested in touching it or anything .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: does he play play with other infants ?
*EXP: maybe ?
*MOT: he does play with other infants .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: because he is in daycare a couple days um a week .
*MOT: so hes with like uh theres six of them in a room .
*MOT: including him .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: and and they all know each other .
*MOT: because theyve been there f for a while .
*MOT: so he hell react to those infants .
*EXP: oh .
*EXP: aw .
*MOT: and then the books .
*MOT: we have this one at home .
*MOT: and we have this one at home .
*MOT: but these .
*MOT: the two that I read we dont have at home .
*MOT: um but we have a lot of books .
*MOT: we we um go to the library to get the books .
*MOT: so they kinda change differently .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so um but normally he really likes those .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: do you play ever play like pattycake ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah we do .
*EXP: um but today you didnt do any like extraneous outside like outside of these toys today ?
*MOT: hm no just the .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but and he just learned how to clap so its its thats uh patty cakes pretty fun for him .
*EXP: and peekaboo ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: he loves peeka boo .
*MOT: at home too we do that .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: and so he sits and listens .
*EXP: if you were to say toys versus books here today what do you think ?
*MOT: I think he would understand .
*MOT: because we or at least we have like a play area and then we have like a big basket of books .
*MOT: and so whenever he sees us pull out the big basket hell like shriek .
*MOT: you know thats kind of how he shows happiness right now .
*MOT: and I dont know .
*MOT: maybe its because we cuddle with him more when we read .
*MOT: and we both will read to him .
*MOT: both my husband and I .
*MOT: um but he seems to get happy and then hell like shriek while were reading sometimes too .
*MOT: thats why you know xxx he didnt do that here but normally he really likes it .
*MOT: but hes also just started scooting so hes really interested in moving right now .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um but so at home he it was .
*EXP: I guess you just gave me a comparison .
*EXP: at home he seemed a little bit more interested or excited about books .
*MOT: well yeah because we dont just leave them out because their library books .
*MOT: so when we bring them out he knows were going to read to him and then he he gets happy .
*MOT: where as his toys we kinda just leave out .
*MOT: you know so he can get them whenever he wants .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: okay that makes sense .
*EXP: thats so funny .
*EXP: hes like looking at the baby and saying .
*EXP: what are you eyeing at ?
*EXP: its my clock .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay well great .
*EXP: I um I think thats it .
*EXP: got through all the questions .
