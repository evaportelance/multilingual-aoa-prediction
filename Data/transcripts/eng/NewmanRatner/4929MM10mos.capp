*MOT: um stuffed animals dont .
*MOT: Imean she just kindof likes to hug them .
*MOT: and throw them throw them aside .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: I think its more because shh I think the last time I was saying she uses them more at night .

*MOT: good job .
*EXP: is there any reason why ?
*EXP: is it because of the flaps or ?
