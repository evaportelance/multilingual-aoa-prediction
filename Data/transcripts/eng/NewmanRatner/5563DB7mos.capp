*MOT: he likes the plastic toys the best so far .
*EXP: ah .
*MOT: so he likes this thing .
*MOT: s I think because of maybe the feel or the sound they make .
*MOT: but hes really liking the keys .
*MOT: say .
*MOT: we have keys at home but these are more fun .
*MOT: mainly the plates and the the keys .
*MOT: and now the icecream .
*EXP: are they also um toy keys that you have at home ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: theyre much bigger though .
*MOT: thats the only difference .
*MOT: so maybe thats why he likes them .
*EXP: so hes really going for those a lot .
*MOT: he is yes .
*MOT: and easy to hold .
*MOT: hah and now you found the blocks .
*EXP: so you think because theyre easy to hold and maybe they make a noise .
*MOT: ma I he likes things that make noises .
*MOT: rattles and things like that .
*MOT: dont ya ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: he looks busy .
*MOT: hes usually interrupted .
*MOT: so this is one of the few times he hasnt been interrupted by big sister .
*EXP: ahhah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: hah spoon .
*MOT: yay .
*EXP: um so out of these toys here what do you think is the best for his kinda personality ?
*MOT: for his personality ?
*MOT: um h right now he likes things that he can grab .
*MOT: like these things .
*MOT: we have alotof these he xxx gone toward .
*MOT: he has balls that he chases at home .
*MOT: but he cant really go very far with them .
*MOT: so they sometimes frustrate him .
*MOT: but right now um smaller things that he can pick up with his hands .
*EXP: you said these kinds of things is xxx because of the rattle part of it or what ?
*MOT: the sounds .
*MOT: the sounds they make .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: so these are nice but he likes things that make sounds .
*EXP: so not so much these .
*MOT: at least for him .
*MOT: yeah your sister liked stuffed animals didnt she ?
*EXP: lets see um .
*EXP: what do ya think interests him the least of the stuff we have here ?
*MOT: right now um the books .
*MOT: just because he we have a set time during the day that we read them .
*MOT: I think .
*MOT: so hes useta reading them before nap and before bed .
*MOT: and so I guess his regular play toys he doesnt get them that often .
*MOT: but .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: if so lets say it is bedtime or whatever of the books that we have here what do you think would be best for him xxx ?
*MOT: well right now with us we like the TouchAndFeel things .
*MOT: and then weve also been reading the small DoctorSeuss stuff .
*MOT: a lot at home .
*MOT: mainly because weve already had them so .
*MOT: um things that are short .
*MOT: and rhyme .
*MOT: hes doesnt have a preference for that but we tend to read ones that rhyme because thats what his sister liked .
*MOT: dont we yeah ?
*MOT: so weve read the abcs and the foot book .
*MOT: and the eye book .
*EXP: short ones .
*MOT: short .
*EXP: ones that rhyme .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: or you said um .
*MOT: or feel just because he can we let him play with it more .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: see ?
*MOT: the ducks .
*MOT: the ducks .
*MOT: and you want the toy .
*MOT: because mommy will let you put that in your mouth .
*EXP: I heard you doing some animal stuff .
*EXP: does he um do you read books about animals ?
*EXP: or do animal type stuff ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: um mostly books .
*MOT: so we do a few songs .
*MOT: like we do itsybitsy spider .
*MOT: things like that .
*MOT: mainly just your standard nursery rhyme type ones .
*MOT: so and he gets a lot of that influence mainly because of his sister .
*EXP: I bet .
*EXP: hes getting a lot of fun learning just by .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: things that I didnt think of to do for her when she was this age .
*EXP: do you think that there are any of these items that he would recognize the name of ?
*EXP: any of these toys ?
*MOT: no probably not at this point .
*EXP: do you have toys like .
*EXP: you said xxx stuffed animals .
*MOT: we have stuffed animals .
*EXP: how about the baby dolls ?
*MOT: we have the dolls .
*MOT: and so far no interest .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: how about the play food kitchen type things ?
*MOT: um he likes to play with the stuff .
*MOT: I dont know if he actually recognizes it for what it is .
*MOT: but he likes to play with it .
*EXP: so hm your daughter must have xxx .
*MOT: oh yeah lots .
*EXP: he has access to that .
*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: okay so you you dont think he would recognize any of that these food .
*EXP: Imean I realize they dont all look really that much like food but .
*EXP: um do you think he would recognize any of these food items here ?
*MOT: probably not only becau .
*MOT: well and part of that is is because hes not taking to food right now .
*MOT: um he hasnt liked solid food at all except for just toast and crackers .
*MOT: thats it .
*MOT: so we cant get him to eat any food other than that .
*MOT: where you going ?
*EXP: you said no interest in dolls right ?
*MOT: not yet .
*MOT: he could but .
*EXP: theyre theyre available but he hasnt shown any interest ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: but he doesnt have total access to it since hes not crawling yet .
*MOT: so once he crawls he could change .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: thats very interesting .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: um alright thats all my questions .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: do you are there any things that I didnt ask that you feel like would be helpful in terms of what he likes and what he how he plays ?
*EXP: anything like that ?
*MOT: um a lot of his play is with his sister almost all of it .
*MOT: so a lot of is like the interaction with her things that she shows him .
*MOT: um mainly because she takes over for me haha .
*MOT: she she insists on doing it .
*MOT: things like that so .
*MOT: most of its just all with his sister .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: so whatever she shows him and and then hes probably xxx interested .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and then he does and then otherwise he does like his play on his own .
*MOT: like when Im putting her to sleep hell be playing with his toys in his crib and .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: and then its usually um he does have a couple of stuffed animals that he plays with .
*MOT: so ones a big monkey and .
*MOT: ah then the other ones are all ones that make noise .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: great .
