*EXP: I was gonna say did she like plastic stuff all pretty much equally .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: she likes plastic stuff .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: so it doesnt matter what it is it was just good .
*MOT: uhhuh .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: what else ?
*EXP: what else ?
*EXP: does she have any toys at home that she really does like that we dont have here ?
*MOT: she doesnt have like a a favorite preference of toy its just what happens whatever happens to be given to her is what shell play with for a couple seconds but then shell move on .
*MOT: um the things she likes right now is paper .
*MOT: like Ill just give her a magazine to tear up .
*MOT: and things that make noise when you shake them like that .
*MOT: I just I know that she does not like anything soft .
*MOT: that she is just xxx get it away .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: and do you think theres a reason for that ?
*MOT: um probably not fun to chew on I would say .
*MOT: and doesnt make noise .
*EXP: the two most important things .
*MOT: yep .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: is there um any kind of toy that you feel would be good for her personality whether you have it or not or we have it or not is there anything about her that you feel like would be good .
*EXP: good match with a certain xxx .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: um like what she has right now the because she waves her arms a lot .
*MOT: and if it makes noise when shes waving her arms I think thats what makes her happy .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: she does seem happy .
*MOT: and remote controls shes also very into .
*MOT: they hafta be real ones .
*EXP: what does she do with those ?
*MOT: um chews .
*MOT: presses .
*MOT: so I went and I actually got her a real remote control to use and she likes it .
*MOT: oh that wouldnt be surprising .
*MOT: because were both .
*MOT: oh and she also likes computer keyboards .
*MOT: I just things that react when pressed and manipulated .
*MOT: so its hard to say .
*EXP: likes the response .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yep .
*EXP: is lets see .
*EXP: does she know the names of any um animals at this point ?
*MOT: uhuh .
*MOT: oh well she knows maybe cat or kitty because we have three .
*MOT: but I guess like what do you mean by know ?
*EXP: well would she recognize that word perhaps ?
*MOT: Dorothy kitty ?
*MOT: kitty .
*MOT: maybe not .
*EXP: hard to say when theres so much other distractions .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: kitty ?
*MOT: kitty .
*MOT: kitty cat ?
*MOT: yeah ?
*MOT: you like your kitty cat ?
*MOT: I think she I think she knows .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and would she recognize the names of any food ?
*EXP: or drink ?
*MOT: uh milk she knows .
*MOT: but I think thats it .
*EXP: alright .
*EXP: did I not ask something that would be good to know about what she likes to play with or how she likes to play ?
*MOT: um she likes to play alone .
*MOT: thats why it was hard for me to play with her because normally like she doesnt interact with me so much as she just does her own thing .
*MOT: like she can be on her own for long periods of time .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: I dunno if thats helpful or not .
*EXP: yeah thats very helpful yeah .
*EXP: so shes happy playing by herself .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: thats great .
*EXP: very good .
*EXP: well Im gonna go ahead and turn this stuff off .
*MOT: okeydokey .
*MOT: you want your peas ?
*EXP: peas .
*MOT: wanna xxx ?
*EXP: you can play while we talk .
*MOT: with the toys .
*MOT: and not the big girl toys .
*MOT: the little girl toys .
*EXP: she was here just very recently and I dont remember um I was in the play session or not but anyway maybe you can just tell me any observations you have about uh if shes playing with different toys or if shes playing differently than last time ?
*MOT: mm basically the same she loves this plastic play food .
*MOT: and like she at home her favorite thing is books but I really she doesnt care about the books here .
*MOT: because she has this cool stuff .
*MOT: because like I said before shes obsessed with food like shes really into eating .
*MOT: she begs like a dog at the table for just scraps of food so I guess anything that .
*EXP: so do you think she thinks that those look like food ?
*MOT: looks like its edible .
*EXP: like would she recognize any of those items as food that shes had at home or shes seen you guys eat ?
*MOT: Im not sure .
*MOT: maybe the peas .
*MOT: but I dunno if its just the texture might feel good on her on her gums .
*MOT: but I know that she recognizes this for a bottle and she recognizes this for a sippy cup because shes like .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: and she knows that these are cookies Im pretty sure .
*EXP: any of the other foods that you think shh um shes been exposed to ?
*MOT: um I dont think so .
*EXP: and how about um the utensils and things like that does she have anything like that at home or play with real ?
*MOT: um she has measuring spoons that she doesnt really Imean she kinda clacks around with them for thirty seconds and then .
*MOT: but I guess the thing shes into now is putting stuff into things .
*MOT: so last time she didnt put things in things like she did this time .
*MOT: and remove them .
*MOT: like shell just sit there at home and put things in boxes and take them out over and over again .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: and she did that here .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: so thats .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: thats neat .
*MOT: I would say .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: very cool .
*EXP: um she didnt look at the stuffed animals is that right ?
*MOT: no she doesnt care about stuffed animals .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: does she have any stuffed animals at home ?
*MOT: she has a lot .
*EXP: does she like them ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: she just doesnt care .
*EXP: how about baby dolls does she have any baby doll at home ?
*MOT: she has a baby doll at home and she likes to lick and kiss on its face .
*MOT: but I couldnt get her to do that maybe because this one is kinda scary looking .
*MOT: oh no .
*MOT: there we go .
*EXP: there we go much better .
*MOT: but I dunno if she .
*MOT: do you like babies ?
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: but shes more into like I guess working on her moving her motor skills than playing now .
*MOT: like she doesnt care about toys if she can move around .
*MOT: in general .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: that sorta makes sense for this age too .
