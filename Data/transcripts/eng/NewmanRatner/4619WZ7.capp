*EXP: and Im not gonna write anything down because we have the audio .
*EXP: so um .
*EXP: what toys do you think seemed to ah interest xxx the most ?
*MOT: um probably the spoon .
*MOT: I think he loved to chew on it and hold it and .
*MOT: um youknow anything he likes Imean thats thats something very s something that hes very familiar with .
*MOT: and something thats fun to hold and to chew on and .
*MOT: these he plays with these at home .
*MOT: um somewhat and .
*MOT: um probably just things that are just squishy that are he l that are nice things to hold in his hand .
*MOT: and texture feels fun he likes to chew on them hes teething .
*EXP: uhhum .
*MOT: um I think the baby is was he definitely had interest in the baby because he likes faces and um .
*MOT: his little br my mother gave his big brother a baby doll that um he doesnt really play with .
*MOT: but um xxx around the house .
*MOT: and so I think he just likes faces so thats definitely of interest .
*EXP: um ah in contrast which ah which of the toys did you see sorry which of the toys interested him the least ?
*MOT: well this this thing I think didnt the texture didnt feel good on his his face when I was kindof playing with it so .
*MOT: he made made a really disgusted face .
*MOT: um um I dont know I think anything he likes things that make noise and things that are um .
*MOT: movement so if youknow the tower he likes the towers and .
*MOT: um the book didnt seem to interest him at all .
*MOT: particularly .
*EXP: do you think um any of those books youknow in a um a day obviously when you werent arent here any of those books would interest him or ?
*MOT: um I would say like books with faces babies he likes to look at that .
*MOT: um he certainly is read a lot to .
*MOT: but more because Im reading to his older son before bed .
*MOT: and hes sitting on my lap too .
*MOT: and um so um maybe he has the second child syndrome .
*MOT: j t little Wills dont dont sit chew on this .
*MOT: um that he um doesnt get read t doesnt get as much personal attention as his older brother I think .
*MOT: k so in t me re picking out like age appropriate books it just doesnt happen as much .
*MOT: we read good night moon a lot .
*MOT: this is not good night moon I know but .
*MOT: um so I dont know .
*EXP: are there any toys that are similar ?
*EXP: I know you said you have the kind of a baby doll at home .
*EXP: are there any toys at home that are here or any toys here that are similar to ones that you have at home ?
*MOT: um well he has a sippycup um .
*MOT: hes familiar with that .
*MOT: he ah we dont have any play food or anything like that .
*MOT: but I mean in terms of the shape like I mean we have um .
*MOT: he has blocks .
*MOT: his brother is playing with legos the duplos a lot .
*MOT: I dont know if the shapes are not really similar .
*MOT: keys we have a set of keys .
*MOT: he has a set of toys keys he does .
*MOT: um right you have some some keys that look a little bit like this ?
*EXP: so um I know you said that you dont have much um toy food at home is there anything anything besides the sippycup that you think he would have recognized ?
*MOT: he would certainly recognize all of these as toys .
*MOT: things that he could would be fair game anyway .
*MOT: but um we have we have little Beaniebabies .
*MOT: but he doesnt take much interest in them .
*MOT: he doesnt touch them or stroke them or pick them up .
*MOT: I mean he hes chewed on th picked them up and chewed on them before .
*EXP: um and at this point do you think that there um are any names any names of these toys now that he would recognize like if you you know it seems like you know baby you know that kind of a familiar thing are there ?
*MOT: spoon for sure .
*MOT: um probably um cup .
