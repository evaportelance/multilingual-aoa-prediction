*MOT: she didnt pay any attention to that .
*MOT: she didnt this time either .
*MOT: oh I shouldve done the puppet .

*EXP: what about today ?
*EXP: which toys did she seem the most interested today ?
*MOT: um definitely the peas .
*MOT: um and I think the doll .
*MOT: I dont shes never really seen a doll .
*MOT: youknow a doll baby like this .
*MOT: um I think that definitely caught her attention .
*MOT: you trying to feed the peas to her ?
*MOT: I dont think she knew what to make of it .
*EXP: and which would you say she was the least interested in which toys ?
*MOT: probably the stuffed animals .
*MOT: most of the stuffed animals yeah .
*EXP: do you think she recognizes the names for any of these items .
*MOT: mm maybe book but yeah that would be probably it .
*EXP: what about any of the food items ?
*MOT: most of her food is still uh pureed .
*MOT: so Imean I dont know that shh Imean she might recognize the word peas .
*MOT: but I dont know if she would actually associate with that shape .
*MOT: you know what I mean the shape of the food ?
*MOT: um other than that probably probably not maybe ice cream .
*MOT: I dont know .
*EXP: do you have any of these exact same toys at home ?
*MOT: um we had this book .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: oh and goodnight moon .
*MOT: but uh this is one two three a counting book so its I dont think this its the same book .
*MOT: its not the same book yeah .
*EXP: and would you say she prefers like at home books over toys or toys over books ?
*MOT: shes really yeah she she really likes her books which is something relatively new .
*MOT: um but she also has um like a tambourine and some maracas that she really likes so .
*MOT: Id say those two are stiff competition between the two .
*MOT: it would be hardpressed for me to say which one she favors more .
*EXP: okay um now the animals do you think she .
*EXP: some kids have very early on teach them about animals and seem to recognize some of these animals .
*MOT: she doesnt watch tv .
*MOT: um I doubt she recognizes any of these .
*MOT: I tr we dont even really she has some stuffed animals but she doesnt really play with them .
