*MOT: no I have some books that I put in front of her that she likes .
*MOT: theyre like the huge .
*MOT: books that have like million and one different like pictures of things and .
*MOT: but she likes those books and then of course the ones that make noise .
*MOT: so but .
*MOT: and then .
*MOT: she has a good night moon book .
*MOT: its not this one this ones the counting book but like .
*MOT: the regular good night moon book that she likes .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: um have how about so today she played with well what do you think was her like favorite thing ?
*EXP: xxx today .
*MOT: all this food stuff .
*MOT: like um .
*MOT: a couple times she would grab the stuffed animals or I would try to .
*MOT: introduce the stuffed animals or the book and .
*MOT: she mightve played with them for like two seconds but then xxx decide to either grab the pizza or the peas .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and do you think she recognized the names of any like any of the foods familiar ?
*MOT: um probably pizza .
*MOT: because and as soon as she seen the pizza and picked it up she tried to eat it .
*MOT: because she had pizza a few nights ago .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: I think she recognized and was like hey .
*MOT: but um .
*MOT: other than that .
*MOT: she eats peas but we dont really specifiy that shes eating peas at the moment .
*MOT: but .
*MOT: anything else .
*MOT: other than the bottle .
*MOT: I dont even know if I had said bottle but .
*MOT: that would be the other really other thing she I think would understand what it was .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: uh how about like the sundaes or the the co the icecream cone ?
*MOT: she might recognize icecream .
*MOT: because she gets icecream at home .
*MOT: or like when were out but .
*MOT: I dont think we have it often enough for her to .
*MOT: kinda put two and two together .
*EXP: but thats a big treat though for her to get that .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: do you have any um similar toys at home ?
*MOT: um we dont have any of the food which I should probably get .
*MOT: sh she has she has a bunch of stuffed animals but she really doesnt like to play with them at home either .
*MOT: I would say probably the only thing that I know she has is the keys .
*MOT: and she has a babydoll at home too but shes not really into the playing with babydolls stage yet I guess .
*EXP: did she .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: today ?
*MOT: kind of like I um .
*MOT: put it next to her and she kinda looked at it like .
*MOT: whats going on but .
*MOT: but um .
*MOT: and then like a couple seconds later she went back to it and was like pulling it towards here and .
*MOT: like messing with its hand .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: youre crawling all over the food .
*MOT: its slippery huh ?
*EXP: having fun ?
*EXP: you having fun ?
*EXP: um so you said you have the animals at home ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: does she know them like by name or is she familiar with the name at least ?
*MOT: probably the only .
*MOT: animal .
*MOT: that she would know the name of other than dogs because have dogs or puppy .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: like she knows the names of those .
*MOT: and um .
*MOT: the only other one that like stuffed animal wise I think she would recognize is a bunny .
*MOT: because she has a bunny that she plays with constantly at home .
*MOT: like it not plays with she usually sleeps with it .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: but say I cant go to bed without my bunny .
*EXP: do you think shes um shes at home more interested in some categories ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: um stuffed animals dolls food books like that ?
*MOT: at home .
*MOT: she probably likes more hard plastic toys the best .
*MOT: um like shell look through books and like like shes reading .
*MOT: but um and then the stuffed animals but she doesnt .
*MOT: really .
*MOT: play with them like shell play with them for a few minutes but shell always go back to that hard plastic .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: is she eating soups at home or anything like brothy ?
*MOT: not yet weve just started introducing a lot of foods so .
*MOT: but like a couple weeks ago she had pizza and shes had .
*MOT: shes had uh .
*MOT: a lot of stuff actually I dont think though .
*MOT: Ive ever given her .
*MOT: soup or anything like that .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: um I was just bringing it up because I saw the .
*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: so I was just thinking .
*EXP: trying to formulate it in some way ?
*EXP: uh so the food was a big success today and what do you think was the thing she went for the least ?
*MOT: probably the books .
*MOT: because every time and especially this book .
*MOT: because I remember her kind of .
*MOT: messing with it last ni either last time or the time before because of the little patches of hair but .
*MOT: all of the books like I would put in front of her and shed be like eh .
*MOT: shes like theres food here .
*EXP: how is she playing with the food what do you think she likes about the food ?
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: like a couple of times she would bang it together and then .
*MOT: like with the peas .
*MOT: she had like they when we got here they were on a plate like this .
*MOT: and she picked them up played with them for a little bit tried to put them back on the plate .
*MOT: and when that didnt work she tried to put it on the other side .
*MOT: but um .
*MOT: and then .
*MOT: other than that she .
*MOT: youre losing all sorts of traction .
*MOT: other than that I think she was just kinda holding them checking them out and .
*MOT: banging them a little .
*MOT: and throwing them .
*MOT: that toy I handed it to her and she was like threw it over her shoulder I was like oh .
*EXP: experimenting xxx .
*EXP: are there any other foods you can think of that she may be familiar with and xxx ?
*MOT: maybe cookie .
*MOT: uh I mean she has like the little bitter biscuits that like melt in their mouth and we call them her cookies .
*MOT: so um she might recognize it but she doesnt get them often because theyre so messy so .
*MOT: other than that .
*MOT: I dont think she really .
*MOT: would recognize them or the name of them .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay so bread or xxx ?
*MOT: no we dont eat a lot of bread type stuff in our house so .
*MOT: she doesnt I dont think shes ever tried pancakes or waffles or bread or anything .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: alright .
*MOT: yeah ?
*EXP: okay well thats it for the line of questioning today .
*MOT: alright .
