*MOT: an toda like today in particular .
*MOT: so I would say anything soft .
*MOT: anything he can put his hands on .
*MOT: he wasnt interested in making any kind of noise or anything like that .
*MOT: like he is sometimes depending on the toys he has at home .
*EXP: xxx toy that you would say is best for his personality ?
*MOT: oh I would say the keys usually because they make noise .
*MOT: yeah he can see like he seems to be .
*MOT: I dont know if this is possible yet but he seems to know that when he does something theres a reaction with the keys .
*EXP: um which of the toys seemed to interest him the least ?
*MOT: um I dont I dont think like he doesnt I think maybe this peanutbutter because he doesnt recognize it .
*MOT: um I tried to make noise with it a little and that didnt seem to be didnt seem to do anything for him .
*MOT: xxx it up and put it in his mouth and that was about it .
*EXP: um do you read books at home ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: you do .
*EXP: okay from the books here which xxx .
*MOT: well he didnt you know xxx not .
*MOT: xxx books and so were having trouble with him like even paying attention for xxx short as that .
*MOT: like trying to read it without him grabbing it .
*MOT: um so we have that MisterBrown xxx we have other short stories like that .
*MOT: um so we try to get through them as fast as we can .
*MOT: because and then get on to the next book because hes not really looking at the pictures .
*MOT: his goal is to xxx .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and do you think he recognizes names of any of these items ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: I dont think so no .
*EXP: were there any items that you think hes never seen before ?

*MOT: but like this peanutbutter that was new .
*MOT: um he has the WinnieThePooh thing .
*MOT: and my daughter has a lot of kitchen stuff .
