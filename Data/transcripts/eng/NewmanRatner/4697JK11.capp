*MOT: but this is a new things where he gets really excited .
*MOT: and its like straining to be excited .
*MOT: its very funny .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah um so there he goes .
*MOT: thats why its its kind of strange to play with him in in this setting to see what he wants .
*MOT: because were so active and we do a lot of like chasing around the house and .
*EXP: ahhah different kind of playing .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: um so he does play with toys .
*MOT: dont get me wrong .
*MOT: but um its much more physical .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: in a way .
*EXP: sitting and playing quietly is really not what you do at home .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: but you said he does .
*MOT: but he does .
*MOT: he does do that like with in some independent play .
*MOT: he has blocks at home .
*MOT: and we will build towers .
*MOT: and he tends to knock them down .
*MOT: which was why I was surprised that he didnt knock it over right away .
*MOT: um he doesnt have a baby doll .
*MOT: so um and obviously hes an only child .
*MOT: he doesnt have .
*EXP: a baby .
*MOT: a baby .
*MOT: not that we know about .
*MOT: and um so Imean he likes s he its kind of funny how he fixated on that bottle .
*MOT: he doesnt use a bottle .
*MOT: ever .
*MOT: Imean well not ever .
*MOT: but um he I breastfeed him .
*MOT: and then he drinks from a glass .
*MOT: um he doesnt even really use a sippycup .
*MOT: we tried .
*MOT: but he just focuses on it kind of like that .
*MOT: so it d is not very helpful .
*EXP: right thats interesting .
*EXP: so are you saying so he spent a lot of with the bottle ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay you liked the bottle .
*MOT: he liked the bottle .
*MOT: and he seemed to like that pile of spaghetti .
*MOT: ah which is .
*EXP: somewhere around here ?
*MOT: its over here .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: but I dont know .
*EXP: was there anything different from last time ?
*EXP: Ill sit over there .
*MOT: no sweetie dont do that .
*EXP: was there anything that you think he he was interested in this time that he wasnt interested in last time ?
*MOT: I dont .
*MOT: no chords .
*MOT: I dont remember what he did last time .
*MOT: um I think I think I feel like last time he was more into the books .
*MOT: than the plastic food stuff .
*MOT: um but this time it seemed to be youknow what hes doing .
*MOT: although it might also be because hes teething .
*MOT: yeah I saw that it looked like he has some new ones coming in .
*MOT: yeah he got ah these two .
*MOT: and now hes got another one coming in at the bottom .
*MOT: and I think hes got a couple more that are poking through .
*EXP: so is that what you think is going on with the some of the hard things ?
*MOT: thats what I think .
*MOT: and thats why maybe the bottle was really appealing because its got a hard nipple thing on it .
*EXP: right that makes sense .
*EXP: he was but he liked a little bit of the stuffed animal play ?
*MOT: ah yeah .
*MOT: Imean I think that he ah youknow he likes that .
*MOT: whered that bee thing go ?
*MOT: he likes this because I think he likes the rubber part of it with .
*MOT: and .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: its exciting .
*EXP: and you read a little bit ?
*MOT: um a little bit .
*MOT: we have this type of book at home .
*MOT: but he didnt seem to be all that interested in it .
*MOT: what he recently he has decided that he likes books .
*MOT: but only to be excited about the book .
*MOT: and bringing it to you to read .
*MOT: but then he doesnt have the attention span to actually sit there and read it .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: um but he has some favorite books .
*MOT: we have .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: big box of books .
*MOT: and Ill say .
*MOT: go get me Olivia .
*MOT: and hell go and pick out the book .
*MOT: like so he knows .
*MOT: his favorite is the pokey little puppy .
*MOT: which I understand why he doesnt wanna sit through it .
*MOT: its very long .
*MOT: but um he loves it .
*MOT: and he will um get it um every time .
*MOT: like on many occasions .
*EXP: thats his favorite its clear thats his favorite .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but we have no idea why .
*MOT: because he never reads it .
*EXP: well you guys are a little bit mysterious huh ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: you young guys .
*EXP: we dont know exactly whats going on .
*MOT: we dont really get any clearer as they get older .
*EXP: so um what did you think so thought that this kind of stuff was his favorite today ?
*MOT: I think so yeah .
*MOT: I think that that seemed um to be a preference .
*EXP: and you liked the bottle and spaghetti .
*MOT: yup .
*EXP: and those were the two main ones that he liked this time ?
*MOT: yeah and this bee thing .
*EXP: the bee yeah .
*MOT: Imean obvi this is more his usual mode of play .
*MOT: where he gets up .
*MOT: and he tries to get in things .
*MOT: and hes running around .
*MOT: and hes kind of crazy .
*MOT: quiet playing was kind of interesting to me even because he doesnt usually do that haha .
*EXP: yeah well as they get more mobile I guess thats xxx xxx get around like that .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: getting around like that .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: um oh you said something about this one .
*MOT: oh um he has um at my moms house he has a white theres a white stuffed poodle .
*MOT: that we named Nellie because that was our white poodles name when we had one .
*MOT: and ah he loves Nellie .
*MOT: and he will as soon as he gets there go and get her and then pick her up .
*MOT: and so this is a pink Nellie .
*EXP: and so this one .
*EXP: thats what you were saying pink Nellie .
*MOT: you see the pink Nellie ?
*MOT: not interested .
*EXP: thats not anything like Nellie huh ?
*MOT: this one maybe more like Nellie ?
*MOT: what does a chicken say ?
*EXP: yeah hes doing it .
*EXP: so so do you think he prefers books or toys ?
*MOT: oh um Ive I think probably toys .
*MOT: although he looks at books as toys .
*MOT: like its all part of the same thing .
*MOT: theres not a clear delineation that this is a book .
*MOT: and this is what you do with a book .
*MOT: hell take the book .
*MOT: and hell .
*EXP: does he get them out by himself ?
*EXP: and l and does he turn pages ?
*EXP: or is he sort of unloading more ?
*MOT: um I would say unloading .
*MOT: and then he really wants ah to share it .
*MOT: and th that seems to .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: so and when you turn the pages he does try to turn the pages .
*MOT: but we only use the board books .
*MOT: because if there its a real book he will rip the pages out so .
*MOT: and weve decided that we dont want him to continue to do that .
*MOT: so we took away all those books .
*MOT: so its a little bit harder even for his .
*MOT: hes got pretty good coordination .
*MOT: to turn the pages of the book .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: hes pretty active huh ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and you dont really have dolls at home .
*EXP: and um you have a few stuffed animals .
*MOT: he has a few .
*EXP: oh yeah he liked .
*MOT: the keys .
*MOT: he likes to make noise .
*MOT: so the um he plays in the kitchen with me while Im um making dinner and stuff .
*MOT: so he likes the teaspoons .
*MOT: in fact I think I have one in my purse .
*MOT: um the measuring spoons and the um .
*MOT: I put them in the purple pitcher because he likes to make noise .
*MOT: so we have a lot of things that have something else in it that shake .
*MOT: he likes that a lot .
*EXP: okay I remember now you did that .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: why are you sitting like that ?
*MOT: move your foot .
*MOT: thank you .
*EXP: no y sitting huh ?
*EXP: w I mean .
*MOT: w is .
*MOT: my ah mother inlaw taught school in Thailand .
*MOT: and she said all the kids did that .
*MOT: and its just so terrible for their hip development and their knees so .
*MOT: and I didnt even know it .
*MOT: Imean I was like hes so flexible .
*MOT: I figured he can do whatever .
*MOT: but she was like he shouldnt do that .
*EXP: they tend to do it to get some trunk support .
*EXP: its more xxx .
*MOT: yeah exactly .
*MOT: and with that big belly you need some extra help dont you ?
*EXP: lets see .
*EXP: was there anything that you noticed ?

*MOT: or you gonna come you gonna come get it ?
*MOT: give it to me ?
*MOT: be careful thats kind of pokey .
*MOT: if you fall down it might hurt you .
*MOT: um um I I think that he again its hard to Imean if I saw what he did last time I could probably s say what more of his um changes were .
*MOT: but at home I I guess um he d he has gotten a lot more deliberate in his play .
*MOT: and more interactive .
*MOT: so youknow that he will bring more things to you .
*MOT: or youknow if I if I do build things he will um kindof yeah take them down .
*MOT: he hasnt gotten to the point where he puts them away .
*MOT: we tried to teach him the putting away game .
*MOT: but he I think hes on to us already .
*EXP: hes too smart ?
*MOT: hes too smart about the cleaning up .
*EXP: it was interesting the way he took that tower down one by one .
*MOT: thats new actually .
*MOT: he useta just kno .
*MOT: we call him Joezilla .
*MOT: hed just knock everything over .
*MOT: but he has again gotten a little bit more deliberate with things so .
*EXP: interesting .
*MOT: yeah and I had a .
*EXP: Im surprised he could do it .
