*MOT: okay .
*EXP: so I cant remember what was he interested most in last time ?
*EXP: which toys do you remember ?

*MOT: uh I think again more of like the plastic sort of .
*MOT: manipulative toys .
*EXP: he didnt have one object in particular or ?
*MOT: I dont I dont think he had one think in particular .
*MOT: he was that interested in last time .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and then today .
*EXP: if you hadta pick like three objects that .
*MOT: spaghetti .
*MOT: and the pizza .
*MOT: and kind of a toss up maybe this thing probably because I pushed it on him .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: but definitely the spaghetti and the pizza I would say were his favorites .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and does he have any of these toys at home ?
*MOT: yeah he does have um we have a toy piz a small plastic pizza at home .
*MOT: and he loves well he just likes to go in the kitchen in general and just pull out all the I think its just cause its so colorful and small and tactile .
*EXP: and does he have any of these toys other than that at home ?
*MOT: hes got a Winnie at home or we have a Winnie at our house .
*MOT: some plates .
*EXP: what did you find what did you find ?

*MOT: uh lets see we have a Karen Katz book .
*MOT: this one we have these books but not this exact one .
*MOT: we have doctor Seuss but not this exact one .
*MOT: so no none of these exact books .
*EXP: do you think he knows the names of any of any of the items ?
*MOT: this way Wes .
*MOT: you know he seems to be starting to recognize more words understan like all of a sudden really like in the last few weeks Ive even noticed .
*MOT: sometime I think he knows cow .
*MOT: um and pig I kind of think he knows pig .
*MOT: and I dont know you would think maybe by now he would know pizza but .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: Wes where is the pizza can you get the pizza ?
*MOT: yeah see with him like sometimes I feel like he just gets so into his one thing its hard for me to really know because I think if I really if he was focused and I really said wheres the pizza I think he would probably get the pizza .
*MOT: because he plays with that pizza a lot but .
*MOT: Im not really sure .
*EXP: does his sister play with him a lot when it comes to like I dunno dolls or ?
*MOT: I dunno maybe like thirty percent of the time .
*MOT: they kind of like coexist they do play together and like she certainly is physical with him like comes up and puts like hats on him and .
*MOT: puts stuff on him and .
*MOT: wants to make him part of his imaginative play and .
*MOT: um do you think he prefers books or toys .
*MOT: toys .
*MOT: yeah um .
*MOT: um he just doesnt like to sit still to look at books that much .
*MOT: unfortunately I mean I try but he .
*MOT: youknow like my daughter I always say like from four months on she would just sit in my lap and look at books .
*MOT: like this age she had phenomenal receptive language .
*MOT: she knew like all the animals and what not but .
*MOT: he just hes a different kid hes much more interested in exploring like he is .
*MOT: youknow when he is in the house hes always into the drawers and opening everything and taking everything out and touching everything and .
*MOT: that just seems to be his method of learning about things is being a more into everything .
*MOT: this is fun I like this fun little hair .
*MOT: I guess it could be in theory sort of a choking hazard though .
*EXP: I guess so if you stretch him out .
*EXP: I think thats all we have for today .
*EXP: um then we will see you again for the third visit .
