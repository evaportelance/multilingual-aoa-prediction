*MOT: Ive seen other kids that can just their parents can leave and theyre fine with it youknow at his age but hes not he I hafta be with him .
*EXP: kids are different .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and I dont know if thats a developmental thing .
*MOT: well yeah .

*MOT: thats true .
*EXP: it could be love or it could be .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: Imean I dont mean it to say that he I dont think hes slow or anything I just think that um .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: because he has the advantage of having Mommy around he .
*MOT: I dont know if um .
*MOT: because alot of the questions on the questionnaire are like does he talk like everyone else youknow and I dont really have much to compare it by .

*MOT: well you look at girls and theyre like worlds apart .
*EXP: always .
