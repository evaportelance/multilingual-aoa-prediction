*MOT: it says honk .
*EXP: okay I was gonna ask if its okay if I start asking you questions .
*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: hes so in tuned to me .
*EXP: everytime I shifted he was like .
*MOT: yes hes very even when we were sitting in the waiting room like he heard the door open down the hallway and looked towards it like he knew someone was coming in .
*EXP: oh thats funny .
*MOT: always listening .
*MOT: hm ?
*EXP: um so lets talk about the different things he played with today .
*EXP: um do you wanna run me through the session a little bit ?
*MOT: sure .
*MOT: um he has always been very very interested in the food .
*MOT: the food has always been the first item he goes to .
*MOT: and hes always been least interested in stuffed animals .
*MOT: I dont know why .
*MOT: if its even at home he has stuffed animals and it is the least interesting thing to him .
*MOT: uh he loves books .
*MOT: and so but hes in some sort of phase uh and it showed here too where he picks just a couple of books .
*MOT: and wants to read through or look through the same books over and over again as opposed to continuing to go through the books even though theres more there .
*MOT: but at least hell sit still for them .
*MOT: which is good .
*MOT: um yeah he a little bit into the baby and what the baby could do .
*MOT: youknow he pretended to drink himself and then let the baby drink a little .
*MOT: so that was good .
*MOT: and we dont have any baby dolls at home .
*MOT: so uh I dunno I guess he just knows from himself what .
*MOT: what to do with it .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: yeah I thought it was uh pretty good .
*MOT: he talks a lot more at home .
*MOT: like he was talking a little bit here but really quietly and kinda shyly I think just because its new .
*MOT: new surrounding .
*MOT: but thats one thing at home yeah at home he talks a lot more .
*EXP: yeah I can totally imagine .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: we probably get a lot of that .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: um well lets talk about uh what you thought was um his favorite thing here today .
*MOT: um I think the favorite thing is the spoons .
*MOT: the plasticware .
*MOT: things that he can collect .
*MOT: well too but I think Imean overall still the plastic food is probably his favorite thing here .
*EXP: in terms of last time the types of food he was playing with and this time um do you think he recognized more of the items either look or name ?
*MOT: I think he does .
*MOT: uh because at eleven months old Imean hed never had a slice of pizza hed never I dont think hed even had icecream or anything like that .
*MOT: so he probably recognizes all the food here now whereas before I dont even Imean I think he recognized it before but he was more just interested in gnawing on it and putting it in his mouth so .
*MOT: I think he does uh recognize the food more .
*EXP: was he more interested in like the bottle than the cup because hes transitioning in like age you think ?
*MOT: I dunno Imean yeah he kinda just fed the bottle the baby and put it down and he is holding on to the cups so yeah thats possible for him that he is more into the cup for being a little bit older .
*MOT: hm ?
*MOT: did babies use the bottle ?
*EXP: were there any other foods that uh you introduced to him ?
*EXP: like what they were ?
*MOT: uh you mean that I introduced to him in here or at home or ?
*EXP: well because theyre to theyre not literally what they look like .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: Imean I think I think he understands that its all fake .
*MOT: like I think he .
*MOT: Imean he will at home hell pretend to eat something .
*MOT: hell do like .
*MOT: so I think he realizes that all this is fake food .
*MOT: and that he just recognizes it for kinda what it should be .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: but and I do think he does uh know what it looks like .
*MOT: but .
*EXP: okay so he didnt have any trouble for example recognizing that the pasta was spaghetti or like that you were like this is that .
*MOT: yeah I dont think so .
*MOT: I think .
*MOT: I do I don we didnt really go over the spaghetti Im not sure if he would recognize this as spaghetti .
*MOT: but like the icecream cone I know he definitely recognized .
*MOT: the pizza slices .
*MOT: um the spoons the cups .
*MOT: course those are probably real spoons but .
*MOT: uh the bread the waffles .
*MOT: I think he recognizes those for the types of food that they are .
*MOT: oops .
*MOT: are you feeding yourself ?
*MOT: what are you eating ?
*MOT: eating some .
*EXP: and have you introduced the idea of a clock at home or ?
*MOT: not I me he uh he is very obsessed with our watches .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: uh and he will sometimes insist that we take them off so that he can hold them and look at them and investigate them .
*MOT: but we havent I dont even well we may have one clock like this but most of what we have is digital clocks and he we havent really gone over digital clocks at home .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: um one thing he picked up this time was he picked up the keys and looked straight towards the door and was like that youknow keys go with the door .
*MOT: so hes definitely making more connections uh as far as what different items do as well .
*MOT: thank you .
*EXP: um were there any other foods that he might be familiar with that you showed him or unfamiliar with that you ?
*MOT: um the peanutbutter .
*MOT: he definitely knows what peanutbutter is .
*MOT: and likes peanutbutter .
*MOT: the peas .
*MOT: I we ne I dont think I think he mainly showed me foods that he eats at home or that he recognizes .
*MOT: I dont think he went too much for the different foods that he didnt recognize really like these things that are in boxes that are .
*MOT: I dont think anyone would know what they were unless they could read .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: and he didnt seem to he did seem to go for the foods that he recognized versus things that he didnt wouldnt know .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: and I think actually in turn I went with the foods that I knew he would recognize I dont think I really picked up things that I didnt think he would recognize .
*MOT: uh I dont I didnt do it consciously I just .
*EXP: well yeah .
*MOT: just picked up things that I thought he would be familiar with .
*EXP: so for example um like hes picking up the like round do you think he thinks theyre more like blocks or peanutbutter and soup or ?
*MOT: its hard to say .
*MOT: I think yeah I think he recognizes things like this .
*MOT: I think he knows he cant eat them hes not sure quite what to do with them so hes just kind of ignores them .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so um .
*EXP: and then you introduce them with their names .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but he didnt youknow he just didnt seem to latch on to them .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but like I told him this was peanutbutter and he was just kinda like .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: its not I think and again I think its because he realizes that its fake and that he is not actually gonna get peanutbutter out of here so .
*MOT: uh so I think that he .
*MOT: and he cant chew on it .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: things like spoons or bottles that he can chew on even though he knows that hes not getting anything .
*MOT: thank you .
*EXP: pretending .
*MOT: thats right .
*EXP: uh what about the animals that he did play with ?
*EXP: did he um does he were there ones that he liked more or ones that you felt were more familiar to him ?
*MOT: um I think most of the animals that we were looking at that he liked the best were ones that we read about in books .
*MOT: because weve we read a lot of books and we have like like this book we have a lot of the touch and feel type books and one of them has a zebra in it and so I think he was most attracted to the .
*MOT: hi .
*MOT: the animals that he recognizes from his books .
*MOT: because we dont have most of these stuffed animals at home .
*EXP: which ones are the ones that um he played with today ?
*MOT: uh he played with the zebra a little bit .
*MOT: and the seal or he at least identified them .
*MOT: and we looked at the frog and the goose .
*MOT: uh and then after that he kind of lost interest so .
*MOT: but yeah I think and those are again all theyre all all ones that we have in books so .
*EXP: which books do you .
*EXP: if you dont mind telling me .
*EXP: which books have them the .
*MOT: um we have one .
*MOT: which one has the zebra in it ?
*MOT: we have a couple that um .
*MOT: one is like AttheZoo .
*MOT: and thats the one that has the zebra in it .
*MOT: um and we have one that is sea creatures .
*MOT: that has uh seals in it .
*MOT: and the goose Im try I dunno if we actually have a goose one or if weve seen geese actual geese walking around so that might be why he knows .
*EXP: thats cool .
*MOT: geese .
*MOT: and then we have um we have a book thats called TouchandFeelWildAnimals that has a frog in it and then the little frog has because its touch and feel because its the one with sticky fingers on it .
*EXP: ew .
*MOT: I know .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: ooh .
*MOT: does the frog you know have sticky fingers ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: thats funny .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay and then um saving .
*EXP: oh the baby .
*EXP: you were talking he played with the baby .
*MOT: a little bit .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: what how were you playing with the baby today ?
*MOT: um oh I was just ask because he picked up the cup and started pretending to drink out of it and I was just asking him youknow oh well who else who else would want a drink and or who would want a drink from a sippy cup and he didnt offer it to me he offered it to the baby so that was .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: yeah uh and he seemed to pretend to kind of feed the baby .
*MOT: and then tow kind of towards the end we were getting to maybe trying to put the babys shoes on but he didnt uh didnt jump right on that .
*MOT: but we because Imean he knows for himself he knows his different articles of clothing he knows his shoes and his shirt and that type of thing so .
*MOT: uh I was thinking maybe he would go for trying to kind of dress the baby a little bit but he didnt exactly show interest in it .
*MOT: we might have gotten there .
*MOT: but I think and I honestly think the reason he didnt wanna do it was more because he was he didnt have the hands to do it because hes made this little collection here that hes holding on to no matter what else he does .
*EXP: yeah hes been doing he did that in the uh waiting room too .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: it I I dont know if its just a phase hes going through or that all kids go through .
*MOT: I think Ive Ive heard some kids are like collectors .
*MOT: and they youknow because we he does a little music class and theyll bring out like little shaker eggs or something and hell be the kid he wants to youknow pick up as many as he can hold .
*MOT: xxx flip the pages .
*EXP: thats funny .
*MOT: so yeah he is a bit of a collector so I think thats also why he likes these things because he can get a bunch in his hands all at the same time .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: so he really likes books .
*MOT: he really likes books .
*MOT: he has a huge bookcase full of books and almost every single day we empty it out going going through all the books .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: are these um new books ?
*EXP: the ones uh here ?
*MOT: yeah we havent all of these I think are ones we havent read but weve read similar ones to it .
*MOT: like we we have a Karen Katz book but its not its not this one .
*MOT: like hes read WhereisBabysBellybutton .
*MOT: but he hasnt read the peekaboo baby um .
*MOT: we actually have GoodnightMoon but not the counting book .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: so I think it was different but familiar in that way .
*MOT: we have a we have a touch and feel book but its not its not this one .
*MOT: and we have several touch and feel books .
*MOT: and we have some DoctorSeuss books and that type of thing .
*MOT: so just similar .
*EXP: what was familiar the same with the GoodnightMoon book ?
*MOT: um youknow mainly the pictures .
*MOT: because after the first after the first couple of pages um the the numbers that theyre using for things are not the same as what they are in the book .
*MOT: like in the book theres only a pair of mittens and here theres eight mittens .
*MOT: and youknow .
*MOT: but no but I but he recognizes the pictures because theyre all directly drawn out of the book and then placed on these pages and then they kinda start and end with the same scene picture .
*MOT: so I definitely think he recognized that and I .
*MOT: we always do and the quiet old lady whispering and hell go .
*MOT: and he did it he did it here even though it was out of context of the rhythm of the book .
*MOT: so that was that was pretty good I guess he he definitely recognized it so .
*EXP: were you calling attention to certain things like that werent that werent in this rendition of the book ?
*EXP: to kind of help him remember it ?
*MOT: um I think I did when we uh opened this first page I told him like look its the great green room because the book starts off in the great green room there was and then it goes on to list the things so I youknow I pointed out to him that this was the great green room and so maybe that gave him the frame of reference .
*EXP: and then throughout then you stuck to what the book was saying ?
*MOT: I did .
*MOT: I did stick to what the book was saying for the rest so .
*EXP: so they talked about mittens and what were the other familiar things that you think regardless of the number .
*MOT: oh the uh .
*MOT: oops .
*MOT: the cows and the three little bear .
*MOT: I think Imean I think all of it .
*MOT: theres bowls of mush and telephones and socks .
*MOT: seven socks though that doesnt make any sense .
*MOT: they need an extra sock .
*EXP: well you always miss you always lose one .
*MOT: you always lose one .
*MOT: thats true .
*MOT: um and I know balloons .
*MOT: he really likes the red balloons .
*MOT: but theres only one red balloon in the book not nine .
*MOT: yeah Imean I really I think he recognized all of it .
*CHI: all of it .
*MOT: all of it .
*MOT: thats right .
*MOT: uh and then they yeah like I said they and then they end the book with the same picture .
*MOT: honey .
*MOT: hes a little tired .
*EXP: okay well just I just wanted to go over the other books that you read .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: if you wanna just take me through the familiar do you play peekaboo for example ?
*MOT: we do play peekaboo and hell play it .
*MOT: hell uh youknow pick up blankets .
*MOT: hell initiate the game .
*MOT: um youknow picking up blankets or whatever he can find .
*MOT: or like going behind a curtain .
*MOT: that type of thing .
*MOT: and hell hell play peekaboo and hell hell initiate it .
*EXP: so its a lot he actually does a lot of what the book xxx .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yep .
*MOT: yeah he uh he loves lift the flap books .
*MOT: he does find those very exciting .
*MOT: um and yeah we do do do a lot of peekaboo .
*MOT: and I think hes familiar with some of the objects like youknow balls he definitely has a a good understanding of balls and hats .
*MOT: and curtains .
*MOT: um I thought it was kind of neat that when we went through it a second time he was much faster because the flaps dont all lift from the bottom some of them lift from the top and some of them have kind of an angular uh turn to them .
*MOT: and the first time through he was try to pull it from the bottom on all of them but then the second time through he kind of was able to go more quickly to where they pull down from .
*MOT: so he I guess the maybe thats why he likes to look at books a bunch of different times because he gets more out of it each time .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: he remembers things .
*MOT: did you give Mommy the baby ?
*MOT: thank you .
*EXP: and then was there another book that you read ?
*MOT: um what we did .
*MOT: oh we put we read the PutMeintheZoo book .
*MOT: which he kind of lost interest in part way through but he would he stayed into it as long as I was asking him questions about what the different color spots were .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but I think perhaps he was just less able to follow follow this one .
*EXP: there were probably some words in there that were different .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: its uh .
*MOT: and a little bit I guess its a little bit wordier .
*MOT: than say the peekaboo baby where every every page has variations on the same phrasing .
*MOT: uh where as this one was kind of changing everyone .
*MOT: although are you more interested in it now ?
*MOT: see different spots ?
*MOT: and weve never been to the zoo have we ?
*MOT: some day .
*MOT: out out with you .
*EXP: what uh so this book I guess was talking about colors .
*MOT: it yeah .
*MOT: it it says that its um a book of colors .
*MOT: and so its uh this animal that wants to be in the zoo and they kick him out so they he but hes showing the children that they would put him in if they could see what he can do which is change the color of his spots every every time he wants to .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: so youknow he chan so yeah so it goes through and does little rhymes and leads up to ho what color the spots are .
*EXP: does he know those colors ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yep .
*MOT: he knows he basically knows like if you have a the what the basic Crayola marker box .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: he knows all his basic colors .
*MOT: thats like when we got to they call their spots violet and I asked him what color it was and he said purple .
*MOT: and youknow I figure that thats pretty much the same thing so .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: yeah so he knows all the colors .
*MOT: um and now and now I dont think he knows what that animal is because I think its a made up animal .
*EXP: does he have a favorite color ?
*MOT: when when we very first started talking about colors he was obsessed with yellow .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: he Imean xxx kinda before he understood exactly how colors worked uh he would say everything was yellow .
*MOT: you would ask him what color that red sweater was and hes say yellow .
*MOT: because he knew it was a color and he knew you were asking about a color .
*MOT: but now he actually will say hell say all of his colors and correctly identify things but .
*MOT: he still he still likes yellow .
*MOT: especially yellow cars .
*MOT: every time we see a yellow car he gets very excited so .
*EXP: interesting .
*EXP: so that must be that must be the color .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: today hes wearing gre I thought you might have said like green or blue because hes wearing that today .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: like sometimes youknow kids will be like I wanna wear this .
*EXP: not showing that preference yet huh ?
