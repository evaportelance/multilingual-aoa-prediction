*MOT: okay .
*EXP: about the play session you just had .
*EXP: so what was the first thing that she went to ?
*MOT: this .
*MOT: big circle clock .
*MOT: she bit on it .
*MOT: like that .
*EXP: do you think she knows that its a is it familiar do you have anything like that at home or ?
*MOT: we do but its not foamy .
*MOT: its its this color and it has the dials but its not made out of this .
*MOT: its wood .
*EXP: oh so but she does have a toy um .
*MOT: its not a toy but she plays with it .
*EXP: oh its a real one .
*MOT: its for their play room so its for kids but its not something its not soft like this one .
*MOT: but its the exact same colors .
*MOT: so I dont know if she likes the texture of it if she likes the colors Im not sure .
*MOT: when I pretended it was a hat she threw it off so she I think she knows its not a hat .
*MOT: we pretended it was a plate and she just really just wanted to bite it .
*EXP: now what did she go to after that ?
*MOT: um well I kind of pretended the frog was leaping on her and she kind of she was excited about the frog after he was pretending to kiss her neck .
*MOT: she was laughing a little bit .
*MOT: and then she went straight for the food .
*MOT: which is what she did last time when we were here .
*MOT: she likes the food .
*MOT: specifically the peas .
*MOT: but she didnt find those right away .
*MOT: she played with the plates .
*MOT: so something about circles maybe .
*MOT: and she was playing with mostly playing with the plates at first and then I showed her that these were here and then this was all she really wanted to play with .
*MOT: so I dont know if its color or the tex .
*MOT: Im not sure what it is about these but she likes these .
*MOT: she wasnt as interested in the baby this time .
*MOT: in fact she didnt really seem to like the baby this time .
*MOT: um she didnt really interact much with her didnt wanna feed her didnt wanna hold her hair like she did before .
*EXP: so last time she played with the baby ?
*MOT: she did .
*MOT: for quite a bit of time .
*MOT: and she would feed it and do stuff like that .
*MOT: she wasnt interested today .
*MOT: maybe because I pretended she was my baby .
*EXP: maybe .
*EXP: um do you have does she have like one like that at home ?
*MOT: not that big but she does have babydolls .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: and she plays with them sometimes .
*EXP: did she play with the clock a lot last time too ?
*MOT: I dont think she played with the clock before at all .
*MOT: was it here ?
*MOT: I dont she even noticed it before .
*EXP: and the animals .
*EXP: so does she have you said she really liked the frog .
*MOT: she liked the frog .
*MOT: shh um no she doesnt have a frog at home .
*MOT: she has a lot of stuffed animals but not I dont think she has one that looks like this .
*MOT: she didnt seem interested in the rest of them .
*MOT: she actually fed one of them .
*MOT: she fed the fox her peas .
*MOT: when I asked her if shell give him some peas .
*MOT: she fed them to her .
*MOT: to the fox .
*MOT: she wasnt interested in the donkey at all .
*MOT: I thought the colors would bring her get her attention but she didnt seem interested .
*MOT: and she played with this little bottle .
*MOT: might remind her of her own bottle .
*EXP: does she do a lot of play at home ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: she has a lot of toys little small toys that she plays with in her PackAndPlay .
*MOT: and then her and I will crawl around and play with different stuff .
*MOT: shes got tons of toys .
*MOT: she has three siblings that are like not much older than her .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: so yeah .
*EXP: so are most of the toys that you have at home things like this that are imitations of real things or ?
*MOT: we have play food and we have a a large playroom in our basement and she and we have play food down there and she always goes straight to that .
*MOT: I dunno if she knows if thinks its real or if she just likes the texture .
*MOT: Im not sure but it all of course everythings in her mouth at this stage .
*MOT: so I dunno if she thinks its food or if she just wants to explore .
*MOT: but she really likes the peas .
*MOT: I dont know what it is about those peas .
*MOT: and usually at home she likes noisy toys that make noise .
*MOT: a lot of music type things .
*MOT: we have a microphone toy that she sings in it she just puts it the whole thing in her almost in her mouth .
*MOT: and she talks in it .
*MOT: really loud into it .
*MOT: its a microphone so .
*MOT: I think she likes to hear herself .
*MOT: and that keeps her occupied .
*MOT: and then any of the toys that have lots of lights and stuff on it shes excited .
*MOT: Kennedy .
*EXP: what about the um over there .
*EXP: the the books .
*MOT: youknow I didnt really do anything with the books I think theyre behind me I didnt even see them over here .
*MOT: but we do have lots of books at home and lots of thick books that she she usually just bites on them .
*MOT: and at story time of course at night we read them and shell have her attention there for a couple seconds but she just not really interested in sitting and hearing the whole book yet .
*EXP: do you have of of those ?
*MOT: these specific books ?
*MOT: we have one I I think its this one it might be just really similar .
*MOT: its got the different things you can touch .
*MOT: and then .
*MOT: no thats it .
*MOT: just similar to this one but not we dont have that .
*MOT: I have DoctorSeuss books but not this one in particular .
*MOT: and GoodnightMoon it sounds familiar but I dont think we have it at home .
*MOT: I might have just seen it when I was here .
*EXP: is there anything else you that noticed that was different than the last time or anything she did that surprised you today ?
*MOT: um she actually gave the stuffed animals although I only tried a few of them she gave them a little bit more attention this time than she did before .
*MOT: um shes kinda doing the same .
*MOT: she didnt like the doll as much this time .
*MOT: so I dont know why that is .
*MOT: but last time she was trying to put shoes on it and everything .
*MOT: um and she didnt notice the books either maybe just because of where we have it where they are .
*MOT: in relation to where Im sitting yeah .
*MOT: other than that .
*MOT: she liked the pizza because I think she likes the colors .
