*EXP: a field trip to the um ceiling fan department upstairs .
*EXP: cause he okay .
*EXP: um anyways so he loves the animals does he have any favorite animals ?
*MOT: um his favorite ones would be the cow that he started of with that he picked outta the book um cows are are a big one elephants a big one .
*MOT: penguin and panda .
*EXP: ah yeah .
*MOT: and giraffe .
*EXP: and he was very particular about um the sheep and the goat I noticed .
*MOT: yeah actually cause um it took us a long time to get him to say those words .
*MOT: and now we have a farm book that that we can distinguish better between them cause he would he wouldnt say goat for the longest time .
*EXP: ah which of those animals has he seen you know in the flesh ?
*MOT: the cow .
*MOT: the elephant .
*MOT: uh the pandas .
*MOT: um the sheep .
*EXP: I noticed you also mentioned um going to the aquarium ?
*MOT: he has he has an aquarium in his crib .
*EXP: or oh okay .
*MOT: so a little you know an aquarium that every morning he hasnt done it lately but for months there it was turtle every time we walked into his room cause he wanted to see the aquarium .
*MOT: and in the aquarium theres fish and an octopus .
*EXP: oh perfect .
*MOT: yeah so he had those those were some of his earliest words so turtle hes seen live too .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so we we have taken him to the zoo to see that .
*EXP: oh thats fun .
*EXP: he um he also played some with the cooking things .
*MOT: a little bit with the food .
*MOT: yep .
*MOT: um except that he hes into shapes right now .
*MOT: so instead of identifying the first one as food he would identify it as triangles .
*EXP: all the way through .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and and then when you got to the ice cream I thought oh good night does he know sphere or cone ?
*MOT: he knows cone but as a ice cream cone .
*EXP: but that was pretty neat .
*EXP: and yeah for that first part Im not sposta say what any of the names are I I messed up once .
*EXP: because he was so once they have said it I feel like that cat is outta the bag a little bit you know .
*MOT: hes yeah shapes are he is into labeling .
*MOT: which is why were having trouble with verbs cause he wants to label everything .
*MOT: so he knows almost all of his colors .
*MOT: he knows lots of the basic shapes .
*MOT: um you know his basic numbers one through nine or zero through nine .
*MOT: and um the alphabet .
*MOT: so he likes labeling things yes and the .
*EXP: he likes that kinda thing ah .
*MOT: and when he doesnt heres the other thing when he doesnt know something he goes back to a word that hes comfortable with which in this case was clock .
*MOT: so whenever he went back to clock he .
*EXP: like you guys are kind of asking for alot how about clock ?
*MOT: yeah he wants to be able to answer whatevers correct .
*MOT: so if he goes to a different word than what youre pointing at he doesnt he doesnt know what it is .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: my son when he was naughty would start the alphabet song like look over here .
*MOT: yes by the way I know this .
*MOT: yeah and hes hes learned that pretty early so .
*MOT: weve been working with him you know well say it a little bit faster to give him the word .
*MOT: and then hes more comfortable with it the next time hell start using it more often if we you know only ask once or twice what it is before .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: and did he um do you have this one look familiar ?
*MOT: yup .
*EXP: does he have favorite parts of it ?
*MOT: the cow the cow jumping over the moon .
*MOT: and the kittens .
*EXP: oh yeah ?
*MOT: yep .
*EXP: and he points I was noticing he points to the things in the pictures ?
*MOT: he yeah .
*MOT: thats kinda how we read the books is is you know we read the words on the page and then we start labeling things on the page .
*MOT: which you know at this point has been mostly the objects .
*MOT: you know the clock the fire things like that .
*MOT: um were trying to put in action words now but thats not been as successful .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: well I I think that some you were doing a little bit of up and with the kangaroo too .
*MOT: yeah he um he likes to be entertained .
*MOT: so if we if we do if were silly and make silly noises out of it he he has fun with it so .
*EXP: is there anything you tried to get him to play with here today that he was just not interested in ?
*MOT: yeah he wasnt all that interested in the food as as such .
*EXP: mm .
*MOT: you know I tried to get him off the animals and see if he would do something else .
*EXP: are there any of these foods that he you know likes to eat ?
*MOT: the ice cream cone would have been one of them .
*MOT: um bread .
*MOT: obviously the cookie from earlier hes a pretty picky eater so .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: yeah there wouldnt be too many of them .
*EXP: and xxx is there anything that he really loves to play that we didnt see today ?
*MOT: um cars and trucks and buses .
*MOT: thats it xxx that is his main focus .
*MOT: besides he is really big into animals too .
*MOT: um so he will play with those but if you have a vehicle around that will be right where he goes .
*EXP: was just thanking my lucky stars I know that they xxx one more test with a vehicle every three or four and Im thinking if I can just get there hell be back engaged again .
*MOT: yeah he is he is so obsessed with those things .
*EXP: but it was true that .
*MOT: basically when when the therapists come to our house we hafta remove all things with wheels from the room so that they can focus on something else .
*EXP: well I think thats what um the thinking was is that cars and trucks get you alot of and not not alot of other language which is what .
*MOT: it yeah yeah .
*MOT: it was just the first it was the first thing he was interested in and the animals have helped get him into other things .
*EXP: ooh do you wanna xxx ?
*EXP: little guy well that yeah .
*MOT: its .
*EXP: oh thats okay here Im gonna cut everything off now .
