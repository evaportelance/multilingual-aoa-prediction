*EXP: wanna look at this while I talk to your mom ?
*MOT: haha .
*EXP: okay so um just a few questions for you .
*EXP: Im sure youve been asked these before .
*EXP: um but um so my first question would be have you have there been any changes since like the last visit or so last since like maybe the first or the second visit maybe in terms of what toys he likes to play with or what games he likes to play with ?
*MOT: um hes definitely expanded not from the second to the third visit because it was last week .
*MOT: but from his first to second visit he plays with a lot more toys now and a lot more actively with toys .
*MOT: um he useta play with just like rattles and stuff .
*MOT: and now hes into like block and and everything .
*EXP: come here monster come here monster .
*EXP: lets go over here .
*EXP: come over here .
*EXP: go get him .
*MOT: haha .
*MOT: go get it .
*MOT: and hes a lot more active now than he was at seven or eight months .
*MOT: hes a lot more mobile .
*EXP: okay so which toys do you think that he was the most interested in this visit ?
*MOT: this visit was probably this book .
*MOT: um and the little bumblebee .
*MOT: hes traditionally liked the bumblebee .
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: although he does like um he played with the food toys not necessarily because they were food toys because he likes blocks a lot .
*MOT: so I think it was things he could throw around pretty easily .
*MOT: he likes to do that .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: haha does he like animals a lot ?
*MOT: no I mean weve had this book at home .
*MOT: and he doesnt care for it so .
*MOT: this is the first its a pretty similar book .
*MOT: and so th thats new .
*EXP: does he like ducks ?
*MOT: no haha .
*EXP: haha okay .
*MOT: I think he likes the texture of that bumblebee stuffed toy .
*MOT: he always has since he started coming but .
*MOT: no thats the first time hes really played with that .
*MOT: and my husband tries to read it to him like every night this and other books .
*MOT: and he could care less .
*EXP: haha which ones do you think interested him the least in terms of the toys that were here this visit ?
*MOT: um still not into like doll babies or anything like that .
*MOT: um and then hes not really interested in stuffed toys too much anymore .
*EXP: why do you think that might be hes not interested in that ?
*MOT: I dont think theyre um like when he throws or moves a block around it makes a noise and it .
*MOT: when he swee moves a stuffed toy around it usually doesnt squeak or make noise .
*MOT: xxx hes interested in things that like can bang together and and make noise .
*MOT: or like when were home we often stack .
*MOT: and he knocks it down .
*MOT: stuffed toys arent as noisy or interactive yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and he doesnt really have like a security blanket or anything yet so .
*MOT: theres nothing hes particularly attached to .
*EXP: and out of the books which book would you prefer that he would look at with you ?
*MOT: um I mean this ones cool because its got the textures and the .
*MOT: now I didnt re actually read it to him .
*MOT: but its um the ones that we have at home he we read to him .
*MOT: and hes bored .
*MOT: so we but we always tell him the dog youknow the doggie and the kitty and the youknow and and encourage him to touch it .
*MOT: so these are these are hits usually .
*EXP: okay and do you think there are any items that you think your child recognizes the name of ?
*EXP: are there any items ?
*MOT: probably not .
*MOT: we dont have any of these at home so .
*MOT: little boy .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: do you think um there are any items that hes never seen or heard of before ?
*MOT: um I mean the a lot of the food items were very blocklike .
*MOT: but he probably hasnt seen like I dont think Ive ever said to him spaghetti .
*MOT: but hes eaten spaghetti .
*MOT: he just wouldnt know what that was .
*MOT: um I dont think except for here hes ever played with like a doll baby too much .
*MOT: um hes had stuffed toys and um and other stuff though .
*EXP: you have a few of these toys kind of like like like at home .
*EXP: you said you have some of these books .
*MOT: yeah we have books and blocks and um stuffed we do have some stuffed things .
*EXP: okay and do you think he prefers books or toys ?
*MOT: toys .
*MOT: I mean when he plays with books its because its toylike .
*MOT: its not like hes reading it .
*MOT: its he can th especially the small ones he kind of just opens it and goes back and forth because it .
*MOT: so its something to play with not because its got words in it .
*MOT: he could care less .
*MOT: what did you get little boy ?
*EXP: and so you said he doesnt like to play with it you dont play with it but the dolls and the pretend food and things like that .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: do you think that he might have recognized any of the play food ?
*EXP: I know you said the spaghetti would probably .
*MOT: yeah well last not that he eats a lot of cookies or any really .
*MOT: but last time I kept saying cookie .
*MOT: and he seemed to really like that one .
*MOT: I dont think he recognized anything because its I mean most of th what he gets is like not anything like that .
*MOT: I mean maybe the bread .
*MOT: but probably not since we never give him a piece of bread .
*MOT: we give him pieces of anything .
*MOT: uhoh .
