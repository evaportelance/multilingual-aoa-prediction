*MOT: this is pretty stringy .
*MOT: I think the material .
*EXP: its different .

*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and it probably the texture probably feels different in her mouth .
*EXP: uh huh .
*EXP: and then she so she really likes that ?

*EXP: okay good .
*EXP: and so you said the texture with that do you think the other things as well ?
*EXP: is that why she likes the spoons and keys and stuff the texture ?
*MOT: no I think these are hard and I think it probably feels good on her her teeth .
*MOT: and it fits in her mouth pretty good .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: and its easy for her to to wield it youknow .
*EXP: she has a lot to see .
*MOT: yeah shes xxx .
*EXP: um okay good and how about what do you think interested her the least ?
*MOT: the book .
*MOT: the books I think and maybe the stuffed ani the other stuffed animals .
*MOT: most of hers have youknow little squeaky things so it was kinda a little bit hard to get her attention .
*MOT: but thats all right .
*EXP: were you showing her some of those ?
*MOT: yeah this one and the the pink poodle and the goose and the zebra .
*MOT: she didnt Im surprised she didnt pick up on this because usually the white and black grabs her attention .
*MOT: but uh yeah .
*EXP: maybe that one .
*MOT: this was hard to compete with .
*EXP: that one was gone she wouldve liked that one better over there .
*EXP: okay so you think stuffed animals and the books ?
*MOT: yeah I mean I didnt explore the doll with her and she doesnt really have any .
*MOT: I mean shes never been exposed to a doll so I mean xxx but .
*MOT: she was really kind of focused over this area .
*EXP: um so do you have for instance toys like the dishes and food at home ?
*MOT: no we dont have dishes and food .
*MOT: um she has lots of stuffed animals .
*MOT: she has lots of books .
*EXP: and no baby dolls ?
*MOT: no baby doll no .
*EXP: and um do you think out of any of the items here there are any that she would recognize the names of ?
*EXP: or would she have heard before .
*MOT: well I was looking for a giraffe because I was wondering if she re she has a a chew toy thats a giraffe .
*MOT: um just to see if she would recognize it .
*MOT: its kinda shaped the same .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: um and I was wondering if she might pick up on the book .
*MOT: the term book .
*MOT: but she didnt really seem to pay any attention to it so .
*EXP: well see next time .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: she may be less interested in that next time .
*MOT: maybe I it interests me and I youknow this is the one that I picked up first because it was different than anything shes seen .
*MOT: um so I can try something different next time and see if she .
*EXP: uhhuh see what she does .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: theres a lot of change that can happen between now and then .
*EXP: and I know she wasnt really interested in the books today but does she have books at home ?
*EXP: are there ones that she likes better ?
*MOT: um she likes the well yeah I was kinda well shes sitting on it the one that has the feely .
*EXP: oh its right here xxx .
*MOT: yeah um but uh shes got some other ones that just um like theres a farm animal book that she likes .
*MOT: um and then theres a numbers book that just has big big pictures in it but I dont think youknow I think she .
*MOT: theyre bigger too and so that she can they lay out in front of her and she can just kinda crawl on it and stuff .
*EXP: does she like oh sorry .
*MOT: those seem to capture .
*MOT: she tries .
*MOT: she tries .
*MOT: uh I dont know she tends to get a little frustrated and then move on to the next thing .
*MOT: yeah because we we actually have a bunch toys that are kinds scattered out and so I dont not sure if thats a good thing or not .
*MOT: because its easy distraction and then she doesnt youknow tend to work on the the one item .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and actually she likes we have blocks .
*MOT: I dont see any blocks here .
*EXP: that was gonna be another question is are there toys that we dont have here ?
*MOT: yeah yeah she has some foam blocks and some wooden blocks .
*MOT: um and then the um stacking rings thing .
*MOT: and oh and in the waiting room you had the little the maize thing .
*MOT: she has one of those too and she actually does um I dont know if that shes realized she can move them along the wire but she does like to grab onto it and and spin them .
*EXP: okay so she likes blocks and the maize thing .
*MOT: uhhuh .
*MOT: and .
*EXP: what else did you say there was one more thing ?
*MOT: oh the uh stacking ring thing .
*MOT: yeah and she actually she likes anything that makes noise .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so shes got a little key ring that that makes noise and theres a couple other little toys like that if you press the right and oh what she really likes is her exersaucer .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: with all the other youknow the spinning things with the the confetti type stuff in it and the mirrors and oh she has a mirror she really likes yeah .
*EXP: okay okay thats interesting to know .
*MOT: yeah it its a its a fish shaped like a fish so when you hit it makes youknow like kinda of undersea bubble noises and then its got the mirror on it .
*MOT: um shes liked that from very early on .
*EXP: and she still does ?
*MOT: yeah she still does yeah .
*EXP: xxx um okay do you think she would recognize the name of any of the food items ?
*MOT: oh careful .
*MOT: did you put that a little too far back ?
*MOT: I seriously doubt it .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: she had a ice cream cone .
*MOT: recognize ice cream ?
*MOT: xxx I dont know .
*EXP: hard to tell right now .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay and I think I asked you everything I have here .
*EXP: um oh so the things she likes the best do you is there a reason you think they might be good for her personality like the kind of infant she is or not necessarily ?
*MOT: oh careful sweetheart .
*MOT: here you mean ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: um because of her personality ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: um I I its hard to say .
*MOT: I mean I think she picked up on this because it was different and that so thats youknow shes generally pretty curious and wants to youknow explore different things .
*EXP: thats part of the reason xxx .
*MOT: um yeah its hard to know if thats personality or .
*EXP: and at home what do you think ?
*MOT: at home um .
*MOT: um I think well I mean if the exersaucer counts as a toy I mean I think she likes that because she can actually um jump up and down and shes not like .
*MOT: she falls over at home sometimes and I think she that limits a little bit how far shes willing to go at times especially if shes tired .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: um I dont know thats a tough question .
*EXP: thats okay .
*MOT: um she likes the little toys and I think mostly because she can easily grab them and put them in her mouth .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: and its hard here for her to be as active as she might at home so with the set up but just curious sometimes um if theres differences based on activity level or .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: xxx how much curiosity so thats the reason for asking .
*EXP: thats fine were probably gonna ask you the same questions next time .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: alright .
*EXP: comes back xxx .
*MOT: Ill hafta I didnt think personality I was thinking that she was just curious and so she youknow she .
*MOT: she does move pretty good at home .
*MOT: um so .
*EXP: okay well see how she changes .
*MOT: yeah okay .
*EXP: between now and then she may play differently .
*EXP: she may like different things so well have the same toys and well see how it goes .
*MOT: okay okay good .
*MOT: good good .
