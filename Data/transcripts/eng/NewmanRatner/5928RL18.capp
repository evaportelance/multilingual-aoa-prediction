*EXP: is it okay if I ask you some questions ?
*MOT: oh yeah yeah yeah .
*EXP: is it okay if I ask you some questions ?
*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: um what do you think uh she liked the most ?
*MOT: I think the baby wins the day .
*EXP: does she have baby dolls at home ?
*MOT: no but um they have a lot of stuffed animals at the at our house and then at the place she goes each day for her child care .
*MOT: which is just at another familys house .
*MOT: we share a nanny with another family .
*MOT: and apparently my husband does the drop off but every morning when she gets there she and the other little girl feed all the babies .
*MOT: and theyre all the animals and everything and they walk around and feed them all .
*MOT: so I think thats part of her her routine these days .
*EXP: interesting .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: so what are some things that um did you see her do anything new with the baby ?
*MOT: well I have never seen her with a real baby .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so that was kind of interesting to see her actually putting it in the babys mouth .
*MOT: Imean usually we have things like this that dont necessarily have clear mouths and so its just kinda like anywhere .
*MOT: and this was clearly I know where its sposta go .
*CHI: go .
*MOT: yeah .
*CHI: baby .
*MOT: but this is kind of her thing youknow shell shell just kind of go from thing to thing .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: ow .
*CHI: ow .
*MOT: ow .
*CHI: ow .
*MOT: and shell kinda get fixated on something for a while and need you to pay attention to it .
*MOT: youknow shell bring it to your attention .
*MOT: uhoh .
*EXP: do you think she understands the concept of the bandaid and the words that youre using ?
*MOT: I think some but probably not all of them .
*MOT: but Im Imean from the time she was very little Ive been shocked at how much she understood .
*MOT: like things that sort of would freak me out .
*MOT: I would say something I thought for the first time ever and she would go do it .
*MOT: or look to it .
*MOT: and so Ive learned from the beginning I I just kind of narrate everything .
*MOT: I probably do it too much .
*MOT: watch out .
*MOT: hold on .
*MOT: stop .
*MOT: Rosie .
*MOT: there you go .
*MOT: um but I think she understands a lot .
*MOT: Rosie .
*MOT: can you give the bottle to Mommy ?
*MOT: please ?
*MOT: I dont like that youre eating it .
*MOT: thats for other kids to play with .
*MOT: and we dont needta like pass germs around .
*EXP: how about the uh stuffed animals ?
*EXP: how did she play with them today ?
*MOT: Mommys gonna take this .
*MOT: this is gonna be Mommys .
*MOT: you can play with this .
*MOT: Im gonna stick it in your pocket .
*MOT: I think pretty typically .
*MOT: shes very into the animals .
*MOT: its byebye .
*MOT: its byebye .
*MOT: its all byebye .
*MOT: byebye .
*MOT: she loves dogs .
*MOT: so that didnt surprise me that she would look for dogs .
*MOT: shes she totally understands now .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: whats that ?
*CHI: cookie .
*MOT: yeah .
*CHI: baby .
*MOT: I didnt know she knew WinniethePooh .
*MOT: so that was kinda surprising to me that she would c like call him by name .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and find him .
*MOT: I didnt know she knew that so Im sure they have that at the other house .
*MOT: and the same thing happened with Elmo .
*MOT: like two months ago .
*MOT: I had no idea she knew any of these characters at all .
*MOT: and then shes we had a book and Elmo was in it .
*MOT: Id never even noticed that .
*MOT: and she was like obsessed with Elmo .
*MOT: and it was one of those things where we really didnt even know she knew Elmo .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: does she know the uh animal names here ?
*MOT: she probably knows she can point out animals and then when we say it shell repeat us .
*MOT: so the ones that she can point out in a book are definitely youknow chicken dog bee she knows .
*MOT: she knows a lot of their sounds .
*MOT: I dont think she would ever like she wouldnt know thats a goose but if we pointed out something and said goose she would know that a goose says honkhonk .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so she probably I would think she would know zebra .
*MOT: come here Rosie .
*MOT: wheres a zebra ?
*MOT: do you know where a zebra is ?
*MOT: can you show Mommy ?
*MOT: I dont know if you know that one .
*CHI: yyy zebra .
*MOT: wheres the zebra ?
*MOT: you like chairs .
*MOT: are there stickers ?
*CHI: sticker .
*MOT: sticker .
*EXP: how about any new animal thing er animals ?
*MOT: you mean the ones that she doesnt know or that she played with ?
*EXP: like any novel animals ?
*MOT: this would be definitely novel I have no idea if this is a gopher a beaver a hedgehog I dont know .
*MOT: um I guess this would be a sea otter we dont talk talk about otters very much .
*MOT: Rosie whats this ?
*MOT: is this a fox ?
*MOT: or a weasel ?
*MOT: I dunno .
*MOT: we dont talk about them .
*MOT: oh heres two otters .
*MOT: thats an otter .
*MOT: but these are probably the only new ones .
*MOT: yeah .
*CHI: sticker .
*MOT: whats that ?
*EXP: um how about the foods ?
*MOT: um you mean whats new or how she played with them or ?
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: both .
*MOT: um she doesnt really probably know icecream .
*MOT: we dont experience that very much .
*MOT: Ive I thought shed go more for the cheese but maybe it shes starting to figure out that thats like fake or something .
*MOT: we dont we dont have she just got for Christmas but we havent opened yet the giant thing of pretend foods .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so she has a grocery cart but she doesnt fill it with food she fills it with toys and .
*MOT: so here I think the pizza she definitely like thats a very iconic thing that she can point out .
*MOT: but I dont think she can I thought maybe shed associate that with peanutbutter because she loves peanutbutter .
*MOT: but I think the jar looks so different than the one we have that she doesnt get that thats what were talking about .
*MOT: but I could be wrong .
*MOT: do you see any bread ?
*MOT: wheres the bread ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: you dont wanna ?
*MOT: you want a cracker ?
*MOT: I dont see a cracker .
*MOT: do you see one ?
*MOT: youknow she its funny because she useta like books would be the first thing she goes for .
*MOT: and now shes much more interested in sort of that dramatic play and like tan youknow the tactile sort of animals and books are more secondary now .
*MOT: so I read them a lot and push them a lot but she useta sort of just sort of gravitate and look at books and things like that and not really care as much about stuffed animals .
*MOT: and now its sort of flip flopped .
*MOT: Rosie really ?
*MOT: seriously ?
*MOT: theyre gonna hafta like wash everything down after you .
*MOT: are those peas ?
*EXP: thats normal .
*MOT: are those peas ?
*EXP: how is she playing with the food or how were you trying to get her to play with ?
*MOT: I know .
*MOT: I think I was trying to get her to see like one of the things weve weve been working with a specialist because shes so underweight for her age .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and shes been diagnosed with a infantile anorexia feeding disorder .
*MOT: and essentially what theyve kind of been working with us on is helping her understand hunger .
*MOT: because they just think kids like this dont have the same hunger cues that other kids do .
*MOT: and so I try to do a lot of play of where like the babys hungry and we feed the baby .
*MOT: and I try to do that to help her understand that food is for feeding not for playing and throwing and whatever .
*MOT: so I think I probably push that and then I get self conscious that Im pushing the food .
*MOT: so its always like this battle in my head .
*MOT: which is characteristic they say of infantile anorexia is that mom is creating conflict in the feeding relationship .
*MOT: so thats always awesome .
*MOT: but youre but its because youre just wanting them to grow and eat and be healthy and you know that theyre not .
*MOT: um so I dont Ive been working on that Mommy doesnt know exactly the way to play with you about food .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: does she have like favorite foods ?
*MOT: um yeah she loves sausage .
*MOT: its like this random thing that we can almost always get her to eat .
*CHI: no .
*MOT: she does like peanutbutter .
*CHI: nightnight .
*MOT: and she loves .
*CHI: nightnight .
*MOT: you wanna go nightnight ?
*MOT: seriously ?
*MOT: well thats later .
*MOT: you just got up from a nightnight .
*MOT: oh .
*MOT: so we have some favorite foods but often times our issue is not that its a food she doesnt like its that she will eat it in such small quantities .
*MOT: so shell love a food shell take one bite of it and then shell be done .
*MOT: youknow and shell start going all done .
*MOT: all done .
*MOT: down .
*MOT: all done .
*MOT: and shes serious about it .
*MOT: if you try to like do anything else it starts a holy war .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: youre just too busy .
*MOT: youre just too busy .
*MOT: here hold on .
*MOT: lets put this down .
*MOT: okay step up .
*MOT: put your foot up .
*EXP: shes a good listener .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: oh now we see it .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: so she seems to get the concept of things coming in and saying hello and saying goodbye .
*MOT: oh yeah .
*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: and what to do when you get to a door .
*MOT: she shes super aware of all that stuff .
*MOT: shes extremely social and perceptive .
*MOT: she picks up on things really fast .
*MOT: thats one of the reasons like for a long time we werent really worried about the eating thing because she was kind of off the charts in ster in terms of her gross motor fine motor language like everything seemed to be ahead of where it should be so I was like obviously we dont have a stunting issue here .
*MOT: but what I didnt realize is that thats also common with some of those eating disorders .
*MOT: is that its those kids that cant be slowed down to eat .
*MOT: food is more of a stimulation than a xxx .
*MOT: right ?
*MOT: xxx that didnt mess anything up .
*MOT: yeah they xxx .
*MOT: put it in here like that .
*MOT: like that .
*MOT: Mommy fixed it .
*MOT: Mommy fixed it .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: can you say hi ?
*MOT: my favorite new thing she says is see ya .
*MOT: we said I said it once and she just like did it clear as day .
*MOT: see ya .

*MOT: and we were like okay were doing a ten hour drive home for Christmas were not keeping her faced backwards .
*MOT: its like shes .

*MOT: Im gonna put this up Rosie .
*EXP: is she using utensils ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: that was one of the things they actually told us to start working on was to like give her a challenge while she was eating so she didnt get bored so quickly .
*MOT: so she has a fork and I have a fork .
*MOT: and we both work on it .
*MOT: and shes good at using a fork .
*MOT: like she can get it the first try fork it get it right to her mouth .
