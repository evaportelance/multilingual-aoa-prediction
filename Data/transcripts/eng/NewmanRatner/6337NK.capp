*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: you can keep playing if you want .
*MOT: if you dont freak him out too much he can .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: okay Im just talking to Mommy okay ?
*MOT: its alright bud .
*EXP: alright so just kinda talk to me like what was kinda the first thing he played with today ?
*MOT: um I think the the waffles .
*MOT: I think was the first thing he played with .
*MOT: he often eats waffles for breakfast and he likes waffles so um I dunno if thats why but that that was the first thing .
*MOT: and he really seemed to like all of the pretend play set .
*MOT: like the ea the foo the kitchen stuff the food stuff and the baby .
*MOT: he liked feeding the baby and um .
*MOT: he was cracking me up too because he was wiping hi her mouth with the bib and ever .
*MOT: Imean so like clearly like stuff that he learned watching other people .
*MOT: um and hes definitely still teething so he puts everything in his mouth .
*MOT: huh ?
*MOT: um and he liked youknow when we sat down and read the books he always likes the books that have the flaps and the textures and everything like that but .
*MOT: um hes a very independent when he plays .
*MOT: so youknow when I sit here and do these play sessions with him I feel kinda silly because like he often plays by himself .
*MOT: youknow and like Ill interact with him and stuff but um youknow he does his own thing .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: uh one of the things I think that he probably would have done had there been the opportunity because he was definitely playing with the spoons and stuff a lot is he loves having a spoon and a bowl and just stirring .
*MOT: so that was I think he wa he almost seemed like he was looking for a bowl that he could stir something in because there were like a million spoons and no bowls .
*MOT: or pots or anything like that .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: hey .
*MOT: were not leaving .
*MOT: come on .
*MOT: and you dont get to take that with you anyway .
*EXP: wanna come look at some of these toys ?
*MOT: so um he was not at all interested in the stuffed animals .
*MOT: which is not surprising he never ever is .
*MOT: like hes never had like a lovey or a cuddly any nothing so .
*EXP: does he have any stuffed animals at home or ?
*MOT: we have a couple but he doesnt play with them .
*MOT: like he has this one bunny that once in a while hell hold onto .
*MOT: but like hes not attached to it youknow ?
*MOT: like some kids like hafta have their whatever to go to bed like .
*MOT: his his is his pacifier .
*MOT: thats the only thing he can .
*MOT: which is hes getting out now .
*MOT: are you gonna get your pass ?
*MOT: you can .
*MOT: go ahead .
*EXP: he can open himself ?
*MOT: yep .
*MOT: yeah he di he really um Imean here and typically he really likes playing with stuff thats like what mom and dad use .
*MOT: that you know what I me like he watches adults like crazy .
*MOT: and um youknow and he wants to play with the real pots and pans and the plastic containers and youknow like forget this toy stuff .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: hes over that .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but he ju Imean he really does .
*MOT: he like he wants to be like the grown ups .
*MOT: can you get it buddy ?
*MOT: do you want Mom to help ?
*MOT: oh .
*MOT: I thought there was in there I dont know where it went .
*MOT: sorry .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: so with the books did he does he have any of those books at home or anything like that ?
*MOT: yeah he has similar ones at home .
*MOT: the he has actually the rest of this series I think .
*MOT: this is like the only one I havent ever that we dont have I think .
*MOT: that Ive seen that we dont have .
*MOT: um and hes got lots of things with the touch and feel .
*MOT: he loves that .
*MOT: he loves um and any of the board books he likes to turn the pages .
*MOT: and sometimes hell decide halfway through the book that hes done and hell grab the back of the book and close it and say byebye .
*MOT: but not alwa Imean sometimes he likes to sit and listen to the whole book .
*MOT: but Imean some very frequently hell byebye .
*MOT: and he closes the book .
*MOT: but the board books he likes turning the pages .
*EXP: okay so hed never seen that book before ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: and there are other books in the series though ?
*MOT: yeah theres a whole bun theres like Peekaboo and WheresYourBelly and I dunno .
*MOT: but its the same author and its the same kind of kid and the same kind of flaps .
*MOT: Imean as far as hes concerned it I dont know it might be the same book to him but .
*MOT: its very similar to the ones weve got at home .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um so were there any toys you kinda talked about it a little bit but any toys that he usually plays with at home that you didnt see here ?
*MOT: um yeah probably like a bowl .
*MOT: Imean just looking at like when he was playing with the spoons and stuff .
*MOT: and then he also loves to play with little people .
*MOT: the FisherPrice little people .
*MOT: and and um hes got cars .
*MOT: and like theyre um like Chuck the truck or something like plastic cars and he likes to zoom around once in a while .
*MOT: those would be the two big things I would say that he likes to play with at home that is not here .
*MOT: that are not here .
*MOT: um but yeah hes been especially hes really gotten into the little people lately .
*MOT: we just got a Christmas set somebody gave to us and hes like going nuts over it .
*MOT: and he loves those things that um .
*MOT: because theres no noisy toys here .
*MOT: he loves to push buttons and hear noises .
*MOT: like he loves those kind of toys .
*MOT: and hell just push the same button over and over and over again .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: depending on if its something he likes .
*MOT: huh ?
*MOT: like part of the little people play set theres like a lamp post and theres a little platform and you push it down .
*MOT: the bell theres bells that ring and then it plays deck the halls .
*MOT: and hell sit there and do it over and over again .
*MOT: and hell dance and clap when deck the halls comes on and so .
*MOT: and then and I guess just music .
*MOT: Imean I guess thats not like a toy but he loves to dance and clap and .
*MOT: and um hes got youknow like a magnet thing at home that he pushes the button and it plays a song and hell dance in the kit dance around the kitchen youknow so .
*MOT: um thats I think one of his other favorite things to play .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: I guess Imean you talked about how he doesnt really have animals were there any other toys here that he doesnt really have at home ?
*MOT: he doesnt really have the kitchen stuff at ho .
*MOT: Imean at least the play kitchen stuff .
*MOT: like weve got Imean hell play with our stuff in the kitchen like hell pull out the pots and pans and the wooden spoons and whatever and hell play with that .
*MOT: but he doesnt really have pretend food .
*MOT: and so Im try I dont know if he does at daycare or not .
*MOT: but at home he doesnt .
*MOT: um and that that was one of the things we actually were talking about getting him for Christmas so um he might soon but .
*MOT: he he that was all he was really interested in playing with before when we came and I think it was more because it was like plastic things he could chew on and now hes like actually interested in it um it seems .
*MOT: more as like oh this looks like food that I eat .
*MOT: youknow and he actually wants to play with it like as a pretend food thing .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: instead of just like oh this is something I can chew on .
*EXP: so yeah you said he has waffles um any other foods that he actually eats that he may have saw here ?
*MOT: well I was cracking up because he was biting on the hamburger and he wont hes like suddenly a vegetarian recently .
*MOT: so I dont know what that was about .
*MOT: Imean he has eaten hamburgers .
*MOT: um pizza hell eat pizza but he didnt really play with the pizza .
*MOT: I dont know that he saw that and recognized it as pizza .
*MOT: um and he loves cheese .
*MOT: but he didnt really play with that either .
*MOT: Imean some of it was that he just never really made it past the pile the first pile that he started playing with so .
*MOT: what no .
*MOT: were not playing with that its not a toy .
*MOT: but icecream he loves icecream .
*MOT: my gosh .
*MOT: I dont know how he didnt turn into icecream this summer .
*MOT: because Mommy and Daddy are suckers .
*MOT: and he loves to drink milk and juice .
*MOT: and Imean he loves to drink so .
*MOT: the sippycups were like .
*MOT: and normally hes got real ones of those so he was probably a little bit frustrated .
*MOT: hey .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: yeah you wanna put hand sanitizer on dont you .
*MOT: here why dont you come over here ?
*MOT: sit by Mom .

*MOT: but hes totally fine playing on his own too .
*MOT: Imean hes alway always has been .
*MOT: and like well Imean since he was little we would try to sit down and play with him and we always felt kinda useless because he had his thing going on youknow ?
*MOT: and there were times that I would say like hey look at this or try it this way and he was completely oblivious to what I was saying because he was focused .
*MOT: so um .
