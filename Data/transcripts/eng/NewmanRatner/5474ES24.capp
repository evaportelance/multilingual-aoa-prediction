*MOT: linguistically its kind of interesting .
*MOT: like what she uh she does .
*MOT: Im actually afraid that youre actually testing me .
*EXP: well actually now that were there um let me get to that .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: for all this time shes been coming in and youve been coming in and um weve been recording her and weve also been recording you .
*MOT: oh yay .
*EXP: um and we dont talk about it at the beginning because its already weird enough in the little room with the ladies and um .
*EXP: and were afraid that youknow people would alter what they did even more .
*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: if we talked earlier .
*EXP: but were looking at one of the things were also looking at is how people talk to their children and how their their speech and language change to their children as children get older .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: as children understand more because when you first came when she was seven months old the chances of her understanding most of these were very minimal .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: and then um as they get older their chances of understanding increase but also on pace with um what they might produce .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: right right right .
*EXP: if theyre in a repeating mode or not .
*EXP: and so were looking at um particularly some acoustic things .
*EXP: thats one one of the things weve looked at sofar where um we look at how distinctly someone says something like cat .
*EXP: I just said it without alotof t .
*EXP: and .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: but you get it and its pretty normal .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: um so were looking at how people do that for people who might be learning alot of new words cat and can cat and .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: or youknow .
*EXP: and wed love to do that for that we need your permission .
*MOT: oh thats fine .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: on the back xxx here .
*EXP: so that one is this one .
*EXP: so let me just .
*MOT: you can do whatever you wanna with anything .
*EXP: and this is um its got two and its initial and initial sign .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and then um .
*EXP: this is kindof how it works with with the um research approval after the final consent form we thought of something else .
*MOT: oh okay .
*EXP: so we hadta make another one .
*MOT: thats fine .
*EXP: and I said theyre working on a um weve had for a long time an online database of child language .
*MOT: uhuh .
*EXP: and um its transcripts on the computer .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: and its really interesting but its only as interesting as the transcripts .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: and our better computers but we can now keep digital audio .
*MOT: oh cool .
*MOT: and so it isnt there yet but the University of Maryland with some other universities are hoping to put together an online audio missing database of child language .
*MOT: but .
*MOT: oh okay .
*EXP: in something like that we can search for things that we dont even know are important yet .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: like these acoustic pieces .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: that are lost when someone transcribes it .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: all of it is is completely deidentified anytime we mentioned youknow that you have a bunny where you live your name her name .
*EXP: that gets bleeped out .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and it also gets kept separately from the demographic information .
*MOT: its okay if you tell people that we have a bunny .
*EXP: well youknow .
*MOT: I dont think that anyones gonna care I know what you mean .
*EXP: but also if you know ten years from now you think gosh itd be so cute to hear her we couldnt find it because its not kept with your information anymore .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: it goes into the pile .
*MOT: into the void .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: it goes into the void its okay .
*EXP: Imean its conceivably I dont see how you could find it .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: theres no way basically .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: youd hafta listen to them all .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and then pick out your kid ?
*MOT: thatd be an interesting study .
*EXP: itd be thousands ten years later .
*MOT: xxx can you but if you listens yeah well like could like pick out like .
*EXP: and can you remember .
*EXP: what you talked about .
*EXP: yeah so for that there are three flavors this one is just to be in this research .
*MOT: uhuh .
*EXP: this one is yes we can use transcripts but not those audio files and this one is the most permissive to let us contribute our audio missing files to other peoples research so you choose one here and you sign .
*MOT: uhuh .
*MOT: uhuh .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and do you have um have more any questions for me about the things we did today ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: well thats easy .
*MOT: we we just come in for I think its fun .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: just call and and ask .
