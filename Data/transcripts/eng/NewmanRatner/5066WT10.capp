*EXP: keep going .
*MOT: okay good .
*EXP: haha .
*EXP: um have you um noticed any difference this time with the toys that he played with compared to last time ?
*MOT: a broader interest um and a more diverse number of them .
*EXP: okay are there specific ones I see you know you played with the food is there a specific food item that he you know played with the most maybe ?
*MOT: um he seemed to be excited about the ice cream cones um in the beginning and then they got his interest again so I would hafta say thats probably the one that sticks in my mind .
*MOT: um pizza seems to interesting as well um of the food items I think that those would probably be his favorite if I was to label them uh and theyre chewy .
*MOT: and the bottle but thats just reminding him that hes hungry and teething .
*EXP: its time yeah .
*MOT: so its hard to say if thats entertainment value or um a demonstration of hunger but anyway .
*EXP: do you think he recognized the names as you were playing with them of the items .
*MOT: spoon he knows um because we play with a lot of spoons and he likes spoons but the rest of them .
*MOT: plate maybe .
*MOT: um but Im trying to think of anything else theres nothing else in here .
*MOT: but yeah just spoon and plate I think would be the limit of his understanding of utensils .
*EXP: okay haha um how about the activities that you do you have these this play uh this play food at home ?
*MOT: no um but he goes for it he loves it every time he sees f play food I probably should get some we have a play kitchen and so he plays with cups and spoons and um a variety of kitchen implements pots pans but no no food .
*EXP: okay and um how about uh books in general ?
*EXP: does he tend to like uh toys more or books more ?
*MOT: he likes toys more .
*MOT: we do books and um sometimes hes in the mood for books but most frequently toys are more interesting .
*EXP: okay .

*EXP: haha .
*MOT: hi what do ya find ?

*MOT: okay .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: I I guess in here yeah the the hiding the treasures inside of things because its fun to pull them out um I guess the picture was good for that .
*MOT: um and I recently actually discovered here the first time that he is interested in the faces of something that looks like a child .
*MOT: um and hes hes very interactive with other babies which is I dunno he and he has always been I just didnt put it together that hed be interested in babies .
*MOT: so George here was helpful for that .
*MOT: and um we recently got a plastic baby that he does the same thing like kisses and chews on its head haha but hell kiss its face and chew on the back of its head .
*MOT: oh I dont know what that is but um thats part of his fun .
*MOT: um but not frequently its just a random interest .
*MOT: oh .
*EXP: does he ever try to feed the doll at home or .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: do any activities that way or .
*MOT: no attempt to do any nurturing or parenting its just mostly a I wanna touch you and interact in some way with you but not in assistance no .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um and then I also noticed the you kept bringing up about the music like using the toys for .
*MOT: um hes very musical .
*MOT: he we usually have music playing and when he finds a song he likes as were playing along hell stop hell listen hell start to dance to it .
*MOT: um and so and hell sing .
*MOT: and sometimes if there is no music on hell start singing when hes playing with things and um he does this ah .
*MOT: haha but its obvious that hes singing .
*MOT: um and so sometimes I can get him to do it when hes when he feels like it I guess .
*EXP: thats so cute .
*EXP: um okay so the question of the day what toy do you think interested him the most today ?
