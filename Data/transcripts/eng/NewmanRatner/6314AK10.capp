*MOT: because see we have a lot of baby dolls at home but her older sister my older ones not real into that stuff .
*MOT: shes more of a dress up and dance than the kitchenny stuff so I dont she doesnt see the older one do it as much so it didnt seem to I thought I just assumed youknow shed follow the older one youknow thats why this stuff is all over my house all the time .
*MOT: so I dont know if she plays with that because thats what she kinda knows from our kitchen or what .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: Im hoping shell be a like a mommy girl .
*MOT: my older ones not real into that .
*EXP: do you try to um youknow play with the baby in a way thats .

*MOT: I dont remember I think it was this stuff too .
*MOT: the noise makers and the food the plastic food last time she was really hooked on these .
*MOT: the waffles I remember that .
*MOT: I dont know if it was the texture youknow ?
*MOT: this time it was the peas she kept picking up the peas or .
*MOT: the icecreams but I also showed her the icecream and she loves to eat the icecream .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: I pointed that out to her .
*MOT: I pointed out the pizza to her but she didnt pay too much attention to that .
*EXP: do you think she recognizes some of the food ?
*EXP: as the play food that you have at home ?
*MOT: she might we have icecreams at home yeah I think as play the play food yeah not as the real food .
*MOT: yeah I dont think she was quite making the connection that this is like I dont know I dont think shes quite there yet that she eats real icecream too I dont think she got that .
*MOT: I tried .
*MOT: but yeah I dont think that was .
*EXP: what about these items do you think she recognized these ?
*MOT: the bottle yeah definitely .
*MOT: I think cause she instantly put it in her mouth .
*MOT: so I think she was doing with it like she does her bottle .
*MOT: and the cup too because Ive been working with her on her sippycup so she automatically went and put that in her mouth too so I think those she did youknow think they were like hers .
*EXP: that tends to happen .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: so do you have a lot of toys at home that make a lot of noise that maybe .
*MOT: yeah probably .
*MOT: yeah she likes the ones that make noise that that have lights and singing .
*MOT: she loves anything with music .

*MOT: xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx yeah .
*MOT: so they just kinda stay in there so theyre not all over the house .
*MOT: definitely not .
*EXP: maybe thats why .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: shes not really into them .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: theres a couple in her bed youknow she has a couple special ones that are hers in her bed but .

*MOT: say I wanna walk .
*EXP: so what about the books which one do you think ?
*MOT: she liked the peekaboo one .
*MOT: and we got through a couple pages of the GoodNightMoon one last time I remember reading her this one the touchy one and she wasnt into feeling it I was making her feel the stuff but she didnt really I dont think it did anything for her I didnt try it again this time though .
*MOT: but she liked the peekaboo book and thats when she was saying baby a lot .
*MOT: so I she was kinda making that connection too there youknow of the baby because she wont thats why when you guys asked about the peekaboo thing she plays it a little but like she loves it when we play it but shes not really doing it herself yet shes not actually doing peekaboo herself .
*EXP: got ya .
*MOT: so thats why I said a little .
*MOT: like she likes to play it in terms of like mommy and daddy or someone else does it and I laugh but she doesnt totally do it on her own yet .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: not quite .
*MOT: say not quite .
*EXP: so is there anything else you think we should know about her language or what she plays with or anything like that ?
