*EXP: Im just going to ask a couple questions .
*MOT: sure .
*MOT: um one hundred percent with the toy food .
*MOT: and she was mainly picking out stuff and cooking it for other people and we showed her how to work the stove and .
*MOT: because we dont its not the toy food and stuff is actually toys we dont have at home .
*MOT: some of her friends have them but .
*MOT: does you yeah .
*EXP: in the other play sessions did she tend to go for the food as well ?
*MOT: food and books and the animals .
*MOT: I think its youknow those things its recognizable because she has .
*MOT: at one of the play sessions she didnt at that time have a doll um but now shes got dolls at home and youknow so .
*MOT: yeah because we have a lot of animal toys and games and everything at home too but the toy food we dont .
*EXP: more novel .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: we havent gone to youknow kid kitchen and all that stuff so .
*EXP: does she ever .
*EXP: oh sorry go ahead .
*MOT: go ahead I was gonna say and she helps me a lot in the kitchen at home so she knows you know the basic process for everything and its just like hey .
*EXP: thats what I was gonna ask you if um does she help you mix things up or .
*MOT: all the time .
*EXP: because she seemed to know what to do xxx .
*EXP: is there anything else like is there anything here that she did different than usual like with the food you said she useta play in the other play sessions xxx .
*MOT: yeah then she was mostly looking at it and naming and we do find xxx because at that point when she was one ?
*MOT: so its just a big difference from the way she can play now versus the way she could play then .
*EXP: so now shes doing more every time you xxx .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: did she seem to recognize most of the food here or is there anything she didnt seem to know ?
*MOT: um the only ones she didnt know were the things that I didnt quite know what they were until I looked .
*MOT: so like the the tuna we were both a little like hm um but everything that she has had contact with or eaten or helped me cook she knew what it was .
*EXP: and so shes seen like shes seen you eat some of these things ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: oh she knew how to make a sandwich .
*EXP: that was cute .
*MOT: yeah she helps make youknow daddys lunch every morning and .
*EXP: Im surprised by some of the fruit she was xxx a lot of kids dont know um think its an apple .
*MOT: the peach ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: shes been always been a big fruit and veggie eater .
*MOT: in fact like we were youknow worried about her protein level for a while because she just loves fruits and veggies so she recognizes pretty much all of them .
*MOT: Im like okay need some variety so .
*EXP: she seemed to know though I think I thought I saw her looking at the beets or whatever that is .
*MOT: I think its yeah .
*MOT: or the hamburger or the porkchop or she yeah she knows its she knows if like shes definitely seen it its just she doesnt really eat it .
*EXP: do you think she would have recognized any of these animals ?
*MOT: yeah for sure .
*MOT: yeah shes she loves animals .
*MOT: I think most kids love animals but .
*EXP: has she seen any in real life ?
*EXP: like have you guys been to the xxx .
*MOT: um weve done you know lots of drivebys like horse places .
*MOT: weve been to the zoo once or twice but um .
*MOT: theyre all done with the sheep ?
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: and weve you know like state fairs that kind of thing .
*MOT: shes been in the barns and gotten to touch the cows and touch the llama that kind of thing .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: um so mostly domestic animals .
*MOT: we havent been to the zoo that many times just because by the time you know she was sort of old enough to get anything out of it it was crowded season and like its kind of pointless to stand there and have the animal be asleep and xxx .
*MOT: so so well probably start taking her we were thinking March April before the tourists really start piling in .
*EXP: yeah I think um she kept calling everything lion in a lot of pictures so I was like oh maybe shes seen this before .
*EXP: itd be like a tiger picture and then something else um .
*EXP: I know she was like lion so Im like oh maybe shes been to the zoo and remembered that .
*MOT: yeah she she actually does know the difference like she can do cheetah leopard whatever but shes been on a lion kick lately so .
*MOT: and its just like a big cat thats obviously not a tiny cat is a lion .
*EXP: I mean well Im just surprised that she knew that .
*EXP: yeah some some of these are like random animals so .
*MOT: she would probably know most of them .
*MOT: to tell you I mean the lemur maybe not but shed probably get at least like the category correct .
*MOT: yeah she would probably call that guy like a reindeer because he has horns but .
*EXP: yeah she she knew um reindeer in the picture I was trying to get her to say antler and she was like reindeer I was like oh thats pretty good you know .
*EXP: um with the dolls at home does she tend to like what does she tend to do with them .
*EXP: does she just kinda carry them around or like .
*MOT: um she feeds them .
*MOT: she likes to push them in a little stroller .
*MOT: um she likes to put them to bed .
*MOT: what else do you do with your dollies Eve ?
*MOT: do you feed them ?
*MOT: but its mostly like feeding pushing in a buggy and she moves them from the buggy to the high chair xxx to the bed and .
*MOT: but she doesnt like them to be undressed which is funny because some kids are really into the diaper thing .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: she wants them .
*EXP: just take the clothes off and thats all but .
*MOT: yeah and she does not like that .
*MOT: she likes them to be orderly .
*EXP: well yeah she was like organizing them all and shes like no because I we usually just like toss them in you know the kids are like okay cool xxx .
*MOT: yeah between the way I am or the way shes sort of grown up so far seeing me put things away and then Montessori school shes doomed .
*MOT: our place is gonna be the most organized place on Earth .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: thats good um is there anything else you wanna tell me about xxx or do you have any questions .
*MOT: nope um I think I wrote on the questionnaire shes really only gotten into toys in the past few months um shes always been more of like a help mommy kind of kid um and when she really started playing with her toys we went through a puzzle stage where all we did were puzzles for like a month and a half .
*MOT: just puzzle after puzzle after puzzle after puzzle after puzzle so now shes starting to get more into blocks and cars and um that kind of stuff .
*EXP: I feel like the puzzles are the best like when I .
*EXP: well she did like the car .
*EXP: she was kind of playing with it but some kids you know are like enough with this I want the real toy .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: and she seemed to like um the book with you too so .
*MOT: were we read a lot .
*EXP: thats good .
*EXP: thats probably where she gets you know a little vocabulary from .
*EXP: she went she went for a while on um the um vocabulary tests xxx .
*EXP: so thats great .
*EXP: and she does have great um memory and attention for the with the xxx and stuff .
*EXP: I dont know if youre familiar with it but she was she was really um very focused I was like wow so .
