*MOT: we okay we didnt we didnt do the peekaboo book before .
*MOT: and we didnt really use the pitcher for banging .
*MOT: he always comes back to these cylinder kind of things .
*MOT: but that was the first time he banged it on the the pitcher to get the noises .
*MOT: he was always banging them together before .
*MOT: um never picked up the cookie before or the icecream .
*MOT: and otherwise I think he went to the same things pretty much .
*MOT: more or less .
*MOT: xxx and the cylinders yeah thats it .
*EXP: so what items do you like the best ?
*MOT: xxx um he definitely liked youknow hitting th these things on the pitcher .
*MOT: that was a definite good one and he liked the peekaboo book for a little while .
*EXP: do you have that book at home ?
*MOT: uhuh .
*MOT: uhuh .
*EXP: do you have anything like it ?
*MOT: xxx uhuh .
*MOT: actually we dont and we .
*MOT: played peekaboo a little differently at home .
*MOT: we like cover him up with a little towel and he pulls them off himself and does peekaboo but .
*MOT: no we actually we dont have anything like that .
*EXP: do you play any other games like peekaboo with him and stuff ?
*MOT: we tr we try and play peekaboo we try and play um youknow so big and .
*MOT: and pattycake but so far he really hasnt Imean he thinks theyre funny .
*MOT: but he wont actually play along .
*MOT: what do ya doing bud ?
*MOT: um but he yeah he laughs during them .
*EXP: which items do you think he liked the least ?
*MOT: the least ?
*MOT: he never seems interested in the in the plush animals .
*MOT: xxx when I try and do that .
*MOT: hi .
*MOT: wait what did you do to your head ?
*MOT: oh my goodness .
*MOT: um he wasnt really interested in anything unless it made noise .
*MOT: although he liked the xxx .
*MOT: he didnt seem very interested in this one when I tried to give it to him .
*MOT: yeah ?
*MOT: oh .
*EXP: does he uh play with toys that make a lot of noise at home ?
*MOT: he does he does .
*MOT: he either makes the noise with blocks .
*MOT: we have blocks and those little shapes that go into things .
*MOT: so he makes the noise that way or we have toys that youknow are electronic and have sing songs .
*MOT: song songs or the alphabet .
*EXP: so um do you have food items at home ?
*MOT: we do not .
*MOT: Im thinking we might needta because he he he wont eat food .
*MOT: he wont pick up food and put anything in his mouth so the .
*MOT: fact that he put that cookie in his mouth was actually kind of big because .
*MOT: he doesnt he doesnt let us put anything in his mouth .
*MOT: besides baby food .
*MOT: like any pops or cheerios or anything like that he wont have anything to do with it .
*EXP: until he figures out how delicious they are .
*MOT: I know .
*MOT: thats why Im like not like I dont wanna give him something sweet or thats all Im ever gonna get out of him .
*MOT: right bud ?
*MOT: but yeah we dont have any food items at home .
*EXP: do you have any of the same books ?
*MOT: um we have goodnight moon .
*MOT: uh we have something similar to this one .
*MOT: I dont know if its this one its a little bit different but its similar to this one .
*MOT: and thats it .
*EXP: so you said a lot of the names of the objects would he recognize any of those names at home ?
*MOT: no we havent we havent been able to figure out if hes if he knows any terms yet .
*MOT: but um yeah Imean we tend to name them when were playing with them .
*MOT: but especially since we dont have any of these things at home Im sure he doesnt know any of the names .
*MOT: are you gonna stand up on your own ?
*MOT: really ?
*MOT: do that on video that would be cool .
*EXP: so um the toys that he chose do you think they match his personality ?
*EXP: like making the noise and uh cylinder .
*MOT: yeah yeah he likes things that he can really grab and things that he can bang together to make nosie .
*MOT: or things that he can youknow like this that he he likes to turn them around and see what they are .
*MOT: so yeah and he he he kinda pushed away the ones that were kind of just plain and werent gonna make a whole lot of noise .
*MOT: or wouldnt fit in his hand as well either I guess that would be the other thing he likes to he likes to be able to hold it and turn it around .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: xxx youre trying to feed him and hes like rejecting are there any .
*MOT: youknow .
*MOT: um pasta weve tried pasta .
*MOT: um bread .
*MOT: cheese little bits of meat .
*MOT: um cheerio type things .
*MOT: um some vegetables .
*MOT: little bit of everything .
*MOT: so far nothing .
*MOT: occasionally we can we can sneak some in but um weve been told its kind of a texture thing he doesnt like the texture of it .
*MOT: what you doing ?
*MOT: go get that .
*EXP: no baby dolls are at home or ?
*EXP: other .
*MOT: we have a lot of animals .
*MOT: a lot of um not necessarily s we have a few stuffed animals the only ones hes really been interested in has actually been a rather large panda bear .
*MOT: um and we do have a a little a little bear that hes a little bit interested in .
*MOT: but in general hes right now his biggest thing at home is he .
*MOT: and he didnt do it here which .
*MOT: surprises me he takes whatever he can like a box or or youknow we have this little remote thing that that says numbers .
*MOT: and he pushes it around like a truck .
*MOT: which he did not do here but that that actually is kind of a normal thing hell take whatever he can and and try and push it around .
*EXP: hm hes getting more xxx by himself .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: xxx into throwing .
*EXP: and then we .
*MOT: we have a cat who is extremely tolerant that has also kind of become his toy .
*EXP: aw .
*MOT: what are you doing ?
*MOT: oh so none of .
*EXP: the animal names here today even though he didnt well I guess he didnt play with them .
*EXP: but xxx .
*EXP: do you think he would be familiar with any of it ?
*MOT: I dont .
*MOT: I dont think hed be familiar with any of them .
*MOT: we do like with the books we do noi uh animal sounds .
*MOT: but I dont I dont see any recognition that he knows .
*MOT: what animal it is .
*MOT: but like hey Rydan what does the cow say ?
*MOT: the cow says moo moo .
*MOT: moo moo .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: usually he laughs when we do the noises but I yeah Imean my husband and I were talking about it and we dont think he might recognize um something physical we do like .
*MOT: when we ask him to come here we might be in another room and tell him to come here and maybe the tone of our voice or or something like that he recognizes but we dont think he actually recognizes the terms yet .
*MOT: anyway what are you doing ?
*EXP: do you um say any like words of encouragement like good job or .
*MOT: uhhum usually usually .
*MOT: especially when especially when he does something new we tend Iguess to do it more when he does it the first time than .
*MOT: after that but uh most of his play is pretty physical .
*MOT: so he tends to wanna stand and and roam around .
*MOT: he get gets the youknow the uh bowls out and the lids from the kitchen and bang on those .
*MOT: what are you doing ?
*MOT: what are you doing xxx ?
*EXP: there it goes .
*MOT: where you going ?
