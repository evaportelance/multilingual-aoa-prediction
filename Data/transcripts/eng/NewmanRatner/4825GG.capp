*EXP: oh look at mommys xxx .
*EXP: so just which toys do you think were the most interesting for him to play with ?
*EXP: and which ones do you think fit his personality the best ?
*MOT: I mean toys that hes really into right now are block toys that if I build up he can knock them down which is why I started stacking the cans .
*MOT: but otherwise its stuff thats just easily he can hold easily and put in his mouth .
*MOT: so I mean what he went for once I put them out were these cookies which are really wet and disgusting and the peas .
*EXP: oh youre giving them to me thank you .
*MOT: and I think he arto automatically recognized books because we read books a lot but .
*EXP: ew .
*MOT: um he doesnt play with plush animals very much so put because everything is going in his mouth .
*EXP: those you think would interest him the least out of all the toys we have here ?
*MOT: would interest him the least ?
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: its probably the the stuffed an or the big baby doll .
*MOT: he wouldnt know what to do with the big baby doll .
*MOT: we havent played with them at all .
*EXP: okay so do you guys have pretend food at home ?
*MOT: no we dont ha .
*MOT: I mean because hes not really doing pretend play yet .
*MOT: so most of his toys are more sensory right now .
*MOT: so things that he can touch and eat and make noise and things like that .
*MOT: so no he doesnt have any pretend food .
*EXP: so what types of toys do you guys play with at home besides .
*EXP: you said you have sensory .
*MOT: uh well he has um blocks .
*MOT: he has a piano that he he pats and it makes noise .
*MOT: he um has like some shape sorters that have like different holes and he that he can take things out and put them in .
*EXP: look at you rolling .
*MOT: he has like a sound like entertainment board thing .
*MOT: so mostly things like that .
*MOT: oh he can roll over .
*MOT: hes not crawling yet though .
*EXP: do you think that he recognizes any of the types of food that you would have here ?
*MOT: um no I mean his food is all mush .
*MOT: um and we dont necessarily really eat in front of him because we eat after him .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so would he recognize the food ?

*MOT: so I stack up the blocks .
*MOT: and I count them up .
*MOT: and then he knocks them over .
*MOT: and then usually hes chewing on one at the time .
*MOT: and hell use the one that he has in his hand to knock it over .
*MOT: he does play peekaboo .
*MOT: he likes it best when we cover his head .

*MOT: Imean hes still putting everything in his mouth .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: Imean because thats still where he is .
*MOT: hes using some things appropriately .
*MOT: like he recognizes now hes eating food more regularly .
*MOT: so he recognized the spoon .
*MOT: and which and he put the right side of the spoon in his mouth .
*MOT: and he did that with the bottle and the sippy cup .
*MOT: and I think last time he was kind of just chewing on everything .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and now hes chewing on the bottom of the bottle but .
*EXP: but theres some recognition .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: mhm baba .
*MOT: and he went from books .
*MOT: um he does spend a lot of time with books .
*MOT: um at home .
*MOT: but again they often wind up in his mouth too .
*MOT: but he can flip through the pages and stuff .
*EXP: oh really ?
*MOT: he doesnt the only time we really do dolls is to keep him interested on the changing table .
*MOT: so and he doesnt have a baby doll at home .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: do you think he was interested in ?
*MOT: well he was definitely interested in the face .
*MOT: um hes he always seems interested in like eyes .
*MOT: when he saw the clock he touched the eyes .
*MOT: and when he saw the baby he touched the eyes .
*MOT: and he does that with a couple of his books too .
*MOT: I dont know what it is about eyes .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: um I think he was a little interested in the face at first .
*MOT: because he was touching all the different parts .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: and the mouth .
*MOT: but then again then he just wanted to to lick it .
*EXP: I heard you doing something about feeding the baby .
*EXP: did that did was he interested in that ?
*MOT: I dont know if he realized what I was doing .
*MOT: Imean I was just trying to model .
*MOT: he doesnt really do any pretend play yet .
*MOT: but um .
*MOT: and it was when I gave something to the baby then he wanted it in his mouth so .
*EXP: right okay .
*EXP: so he doesnt wanna miss out on anything .
*EXP: um lets see .
*EXP: so at this point in his development what do you think .
*EXP: oh hes .
*MOT: now hes giving .
*MOT: you giving the baby the baba ?
*MOT: thats so nice youre sharing .
*EXP: at this point in development what do you think is best sorts of toys for his personality and his stage of development ?
*MOT: excuse you .
*MOT: um Imean hes really for the most part interested in a lot of gross motor things .
*MOT: so now he wants to .
*MOT: Imean what he chooses at home are kind of the big things .
*MOT: things that he can pull up on .
*MOT: things he can climb over .
*MOT: plays with balls and blocks a lot .
*MOT: um and he has a bunch of toys that youknow if you do something to them they make a noise or something .
*MOT: he likes those .
*MOT: and hes got a fish bowl that he puts the fish in and out of that he likes .
*MOT: um bangs stuff together .
*MOT: Imean its still a lot of making noise .
*EXP: oh yeah I saw that .
*MOT: I saw him doing that a little bit .
*MOT: like when you put him to bed we have a couple um put a couple like chewy toys in his bed with him .
*MOT: and he bangs them on his crib for a little while before he falls asleep .
*MOT: and thats just playing .
*MOT: Imean hes not angry .
*MOT: thats just how hes entertaining himself .
*MOT: he likes to put them through and watch them fall to the floor .
*MOT: so I think now that hes only been crawling for a few weeks .
*MOT: so I think hes realizing that he can get new perspectives on things .
*MOT: so I think hes kind of just exploring that .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um pulling himself up on everything .
*MOT: pulling himself up on stairs .
*EXP: its opening up a lot of possibilities for him .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: Imean he loves to sit in the kitchen and play with the tupperware and things like that .
*EXP: okay so speaking of the kitchen um I dont know if you have these kinds of toys at home .
*MOT: we dont .
*EXP: was he interested in the dishes the food just the whole thing ?
*EXP: or what do you think ?
*MOT: he seemed to go for the food more .
*EXP: yeah ?
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: um well the pizza is kind of what the pizza and the cookies kept him for the most part .
*EXP: and why do you think is there some quality of the toy itself ?
*EXP: or do you think he recognizes ?
*MOT: hes never had pizza .
*MOT: he doesnt eat these foods yet .
*MOT: um I think the this has a little give .
*MOT: so it was nice to chew on .
*MOT: um I think the fact that there were a couple of them was kind of interesting to him .
*MOT: but no he doesnt eat any pizza or cookies yet .
*EXP: do you think um colors attract him at all ?
*EXP: I noticed the pizzas are kind of colorful .
*MOT: yeah that c that could be .
*EXP: and Im just wondering if youve noticed that at home either .
*MOT: Imean everything at home is colorful .
*MOT: all of his toys are colorful but .
*EXP: true .
*MOT: oh he just he just pooped .
*EXP: dont put your fingers in it .
*MOT: yeah thats exciting .
*EXP: lets see .
*EXP: so you did look at the book a little bit .
*EXP: he you said he wasnt so interested in that ?
*MOT: he wasnt that interested in it .
*EXP: but he does books at home .
*MOT: he does do books .
*MOT: and we do books as part of his nighttime routine .
*MOT: and then he also has books um just like in his toy chest .
*MOT: and hell pull out and we put all the touchy feely books in his toy chest .
*MOT: so hell go through them and touch the things .
*MOT: and eventually just chew on the book .
*EXP: and you said he likes to turn pages .
*MOT: he does turn pages uhhuh .
*EXP: alright .
*MOT: yeah honey were not gonna chew on that because that could get ruined .
*MOT: here chew on the pizza .
*EXP: so would you say he prefers books or toys ?
*MOT: he prefers toys I think .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and you I think you said he doesnt have um d he has some things like this on the changing table but .
*MOT: yeah but its really just for us to keep him occupied while hes changing .
*EXP: okay and no baby dolls at home ?
*MOT: uhuh .
*EXP: okay so this one was new .
*MOT: this was new yeah .
*MOT: and hell do the same thing when he sees a baby too .
*MOT: hell wanna touch the face .
*MOT: and even when he sees kids socially .
*MOT: hell always wants to go for their face .
*EXP: I think really tiny infants are really attracted to the face .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: but when he sees kids he wants to touch their face .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: and so he doesnt have dolls .
*EXP: so he doesnt pretend to feed dolls at home .
*EXP: does he oh and do you have pretend food ?
*EXP: or no ?
*MOT: uhuh .
*EXP: okay so he doesnt do that .
*EXP: so you said he doesnt really eat these kinds of food .
*EXP: what do you .
*MOT: but he he eats peas .
*EXP: oh he eats peas okay .
*MOT: but Imean hes still doing a lot of .
*MOT: I think he pooped .
*MOT: it stinks .
*MOT: um his food is mostly pureed now too though .
*MOT: the only things he kindof eats in chunks are like strawberries and pears .
*MOT: so he wouldnt he wouldnt really recognize icecream or bread or anything .
*EXP: he wouldnt recognize that .
*MOT: his food is all still pretty little .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: lets see .
*EXP: do you think theres any um like you said hes he used the spoon appropriately .
*EXP: are there any words names here that he would you think he might recognize ?
*EXP: like spoon or bread or some of the things that you were saying ?
*MOT: mm of the stuff here ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: um baba is probably the .
*MOT: baba and then um the sippy cup .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: um because I dont know that I ever talked to him about spoons .
*MOT: um no he only has bowls .
*MOT: he doesnt have plates .
*EXP: mhm okay .
*EXP: um I think that might be all the questions that I have .
*MOT: okay mommys gonna .
*EXP: which would you say would interest him the least ?
*EXP: these things here ?
*MOT: I think so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: I think thats it .
*EXP: anything that I should know that um about his toy preferences um other than what youve told me ?
*MOT: I dont think so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: well well get another chance to do this f at your next visit .
*EXP: um which .
*MOT: Imean should I get some of these things ?
*MOT: would that ?
*EXP: no no thats okay .
*EXP: th we were sort of interested in how .
*MOT: because this stuff I stuff I think is still a little old for him .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: hell come back at two years also .
*EXP: so no well just see how his interests change and xxx grows .
*EXP: and develops .
*MOT: we should probably get him a baby doll .
*MOT: so that he learns about body parts and stuff like that .
*EXP: he seems to like it .
*MOT: he has Imean hes got stuffed animals at home .
*MOT: but nothing thats humanlike .
*MOT: so thats probably a good idea .
*EXP: alright well we can be all done .
*MOT: Im gonna change him before we go .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: keep playing .
*MOT: keep licking everything .
*EXP: the clock .
*MOT: do you need me to leave this on ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: that way I dont hafta write anything down .
*EXP: um so have you noticed any changes since the last time ?
*EXP: that you were here in terms of his interest in the toys or ?
*MOT: interest in toys ?
*MOT: these toys ?
*MOT: ah no hes pretty much was drawn to the exact same things .
*MOT: he has no interest in the in the stuffed animals .
*EXP: xxx on my lap ?
*MOT: Gavin look at all these toys over here .
*MOT: Id rather play with the person .
*EXP: sure .
*EXP: okay so hes drawn to the same things you said as last time .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: no interest in these ?
*MOT: uhhuh .
*MOT: he starts usually with the books .
*MOT: then he usually winds up on these things .
*EXP: okay so he was somewhat interested in the books ?
*MOT: somewhat .
*MOT: Imean he he picked up one .
*MOT: and then he threw it away .
*EXP: okay and that was about the same as last time ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: okay so you think you think he really both times preferred the um food and dishes ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: and weve started at home now incorporating books into like his play times too .
*MOT: so he can just .
*MOT: like we did like the touch and feel books so .
*MOT: so I thought he might be more interested in them .
*MOT: but he picked up that one and then .
*MOT: Imean hes still interested in things he can stick in his mouth so .
*EXP: so would you say that could be a reason why he likes those other things ?
*MOT: I think so .
*EXP: yeah okay .
*MOT: well and theres theres jus theres variety .
*MOT: and theres theres things to explore in them .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um different textures .
*MOT: um things like that so .
*EXP: some of them make noise ?
*MOT: they make noise .
*MOT: they move .
*MOT: they resemble things hes familiar with like the bottle .
*MOT: and .
*EXP: right I was gonna ask about that so .
*MOT: Imean hes never had pizza .
*MOT: hes never had spaghetti .
*MOT: and when he eats peas they dont look like this .
*MOT: and his waffles dont really look like this .
*MOT: theyre cut up but .
*EXP: so maybe the bottle is the most realistic looking thing ?
*MOT: Imean because that he put in his mouth the appropriate way and .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and the sp Imean he recognized the spoons .
*MOT: spoons mean food to him so .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: particularly this spoon .
*MOT: this one was more like a shaky thing .
*MOT: but this one was more like a spoon to put in his mouth .
*EXP: so he likes doing that .
*EXP: and he did the right thing with it ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: okay so you recognize those things .
*EXP: right Gavin ?
*EXP: alright .
*EXP: which .
*MOT: what he did different this time compared to last time he was did a little bit more copying .
*MOT: which he had never really done before .
*MOT: like I shook that .
*MOT: and then he shook these .
*MOT: um so hes done that a little bit more .
*EXP: interesting .
*EXP: was there any other kind of copying that he was doing today ?
*MOT: Imean for the most part I was f following him .
*MOT: I was letting him lead but .
*EXP: and then that seemed to engage him ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: when you did that ?
*MOT: Imean thats how I let him play at home .
*MOT: I let him kinda have free reign .
*MOT: I dont really direct his his play yet .
*MOT: Imean .
*EXP: so go ahead .
*MOT: like Ill stack blocks or something to get him interested in them .
*MOT: but I usually let him .
*EXP: just do what .
*MOT: j do what he wants to do .
*EXP: and at home if you did the same thing that you did here sort of um copy what he does .
*EXP: is he noticing that more ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: engaged with that more ?
*MOT: mhm absolutely .
*EXP: at home too ?
*MOT: like um if Im if I shake a rattle hell shake one too .
*MOT: or hell come over and pick one up and shake it .
*MOT: often what he does if Im shaking something hell come and take it outta my hand .
*MOT: and do what I was doing .
*MOT: and then Ill pick up another one and do it with him .
*EXP: okay so its a back and forth kinda thing youre doing .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: Gavin .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: I hear him talking .
*EXP: so would you say the same as last time that these were the toys that interested him the least today ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: same as last time ?
*MOT: Im just gonna xxx .
*EXP: sure .
*MOT: because hell just eat that paper .
*EXP: it should be able to come with you if you wanna move around with it .
*EXP: hes a paper loving guy huh ?
*MOT: here you wanna book ?
*MOT: he can play with this now right ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: whoa .
*MOT: like with that car that he got last time .
*MOT: after he saw me move it back and forth then he would start to move it back and forth too .
*MOT: Gavin look .
*EXP: oh its this way .
*EXP: which way does it go ?
*MOT: hah here it comes .
*EXP: and .
*MOT: show her how it works .
*MOT: no no wires .
*EXP: so you may have already as answered this but .
*EXP: um are there any items that you think his interest has changed around ?
*EXP: between the last time and this time ?
*MOT: this toys here ?
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: no okay .
*MOT: were not gonna play with the wires thank you .
*MOT: were gonna play over here .
*EXP: okay um and which book of these do you think he would prefer ?
*MOT: the one with the touch and feel one .
*MOT: whoa .
*EXP: and did you play with any similar kinds of toys like these at home ?
*MOT: just the books but .
*MOT: we still dont do any pretend toys .
*EXP: and he doesnt have xxx ?
*MOT: we just use stuffed animals really to distract him like when were changing his diaper and stuff like that .
*MOT: he doesnt really play with .
*MOT: does he ?
*MOT: I guess in his in his toy box he has like a stuffed cookie monster or and an Elmo .
*MOT: that he sometimes plays with .
*MOT: but um its not a preferred thing .
*MOT: we usually .
*EXP: its not a preferred thing .
*EXP: and does he play with any dolls at home ?
*MOT: just those stuffed animals .
*MOT: we dont have a doll at home .
*MOT: although I did think about getting one after the last time we were here haha .
*EXP: he seemed interested in the baby this time ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: he was more interested in it last time I think .
*MOT: now he just wants to lick the face .
*EXP: um and I I know we asked you this last time .
*EXP: but I dont remember what you said .
*EXP: d do you think he recognized any of those besides the bottle um and the spoon ?
*EXP: oops you found our microphone .
*MOT: no theres nothing else there that .
*EXP: you can move over this way .
*MOT: that he would have had .
*MOT: uhhuh .
*EXP: okay and okay and last question .
*EXP: do you think there were any toys any of these items that he would recognize the names of yet ?
*MOT: book or story maybe .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: but youknow a lot of the questions that are in the developmental questionnaires about asking if he recognizes words .
*MOT: its hard to know because so much of what we do is part of a routine .
*MOT: youknow when we go and sit down in the in the rocking chair thats when were reading .
*MOT: so he knows were reading .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: theres one book that hes started to recognize that he actually says something when he sees .
*MOT: he has the book um moo baa lalala .
*MOT: its the Sandra Boyton book .
*MOT: and when he sees it he goes .
*MOT: Lala .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: you know that huh ?
*MOT: so he knows that book .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: but .
*EXP: um and then are there .
*EXP: so thats oh that you answered my next question .
*EXP: yeah if there any th any items at home that you think he would recognize that he doesnt have here .
*EXP: so that particular book .
*MOT: by by by the name of it ?
*EXP: yeah by the name of it .
*MOT: its so hard to know what words he knows because we pair everything with gestures .
*MOT: youknow s I always it was so hard to fill out those questionnaires because theres very little that we do without a gesture with it .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: youknow when we say eat were always saying eat or walking over to his highchair or showing him food .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: when its time for a baba we say baba and show him the bottle .
*EXP: so you were having to take a guess but .
*MOT: Im taking a guess on a lot of things .
*EXP: okay well thats fine .
*MOT: Imean I think he recognizes animal sounds .
*MOT: like moo and woof woof or whatever .
*EXP: okay well thats great .
*EXP: thats thats all we need .
*EXP: just a general idea of .
*MOT: but hes still right now this is Imean his main thing now is just gross motor things .
*MOT: and hes just learned how to climb .
*MOT: and thats really what he wants to do .
*EXP: itll be interesting to see what hes like when he comes back in two years .
*MOT: hopefully hes talking when hes two .
*MOT: he comes back in two years .
*MOT: or he comes back when hes two ?
*EXP: when hes two .
*MOT: so about a year .
