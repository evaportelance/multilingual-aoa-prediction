*MOT: theres a doggie .
*EXP: okay its been fifteen minutes .
*EXP: so that part is done .
*EXP: how did the toys taste ?
*EXP: good ?
*EXP: so then we just have a few follow up questions .
*EXP: Im not going to write down the answers because Ill just let the microphone pick it up .
*EXP: um the first question is which of the toys seemed to interest your child the most ?
*MOT: uh the plastic food .
*MOT: related I mean you know this bin .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and which is a good toy for his personality ?
*MOT: um that is a weird question .
*EXP: yeah some of these are kind of not xxx questions .
*MOT: I I mean I thought that you know the these block things were good because he i he likes to knock things over and pick them up and eat them and then knock them over .
*MOT: so the that that worked that worked well .
*MOT: he usually is much more mobile .
*MOT: um but I guess everything was so fascinating you know .
*EXP: and kind of right up in his .
*EXP: which of the toys seemed to interest your child the least ?
*MOT: um I would say the books and the other baby .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: why do you think that is ?
*MOT: um I I think maybe he he often he might associate books with going to sleep .
*MOT: um and I dont know why hes not interested in the other baby .
*MOT: I mean hes an only child .
*MOT: uh we dont see a lot of other babies .
*MOT: so maybe he doesnt really realize what its sposta be .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: either that or hes a sociopath .
*MOT: I have no idea .
*MOT: which I hope thats not the right answer .
*MOT: because he did kind of bite the baby on the head so Im not sure .
*EXP: well hes also biting xxx so .
*MOT: well call it a kiss .
*EXP: a love bite .
*MOT: thats right .
*EXP: um if he did like books which do you think he would prefer to read or look at with you ?
*MOT: um lets see .
*MOT: I think that he um probably this peekaboo book .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: just because it is a little bit more interactive .
*MOT: but um when we when we read books he generally does try to eat them still .
*MOT: um the only one he really doesnt eat too much is goodnight moon .
*MOT: but thats because we read it to him right before we put him to bed .
*MOT: so I mean he definitely would have thought that was bedtime .
*MOT: and not been happy about it .
*EXP: were there any items you think your child didnt know the name of ?
*MOT: oh pretty much everything .
*MOT: yeah were not hes very physically advanced .
*MOT: were not so sure how smart he is .
*MOT: good thing hes got good hair .
*EXP: thank goodness thats what my mom useta say .
*EXP: thank goodness you xxx .
*EXP: do you have any toys like these at home ?
*MOT: um no not really .
*MOT: we have blocks you know traditional blocks .
*MOT: um I do let him play with a lot of the kitchen plastic kitchen utensils .
*MOT: no knives .
*MOT: just for the record .
*MOT: no sweetie .
*MOT: thats not a toy .
*EXP: I know .
*EXP: doesnt that look like something fun to put in your mouth ?
*EXP: its not .
*EXP: trust us .
*MOT: oh youre so silly .
*MOT: um so um not really .
*MOT: we dont really have .
*MOT: hes got things that .
*MOT: hes got a little drum a little wooden drum that makes noise that rolls .
*MOT: but I would say we dont really have anything like this at home .
*MOT: except for the kitchen stuff .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um I think we already answered this but do you think your child prefers books or toys ?
*MOT: toys .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: do you ever play with pretend you have pretend food .
*EXP: do you ever pretend to feed dolls at home and what do you do ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: we do not .
*EXP: and I think you already answered this .
*EXP: he doesnt he does not play with any dolls right ?
*MOT: uh he has um uh he has a couple like these kinds of stuffed animal style but not like baby dolls .
*MOT: he doesnt have a baby doll .
*MOT: mostly did you see how he greeted the kangaroo ?
*EXP: no what did he do ?
*MOT: um he hugged it .
*MOT: he went really he got all excited and when and then put it in his mouth .
*MOT: because we have a we have a kangaroo uh puppet hand puppet at home that has a little joey in the pouch too .
