*MOT: shes been getting her shes starting to eat solids .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: so shes been um probably the last month shes been eating actually not month and a half shes been eating solids but shes getting introduced to food but .
*MOT: it seemed like shes real interested in all the food toys .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: um she liked peas and the spaghetti .
*MOT: alot .
*MOT: um she liked the bread .
*MOT: bread peas spaghetti .
*MOT: what else did you like ?
*MOT: she liked the frog .
*MOT: and she actually was interested in the book but she wanted to eat it mostly .
*MOT: tried to actually read it to her she got mad so .
*EXP: do you have any of these books at home ?
*MOT: uh we have MisterBrown .
*MOT: and TheFootBook .
*MOT: xxx have those two .
*MOT: and we have a book thats similar to this .
*MOT: with like the fur coming out of it but not this one .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and we have a book thats similar to this one too actually .
*MOT: but yeah we have alot of books at home .
*MOT: yeah we have one thats very similar to this one but its not not that one .
*MOT: and then we have the regular GoodNightMoon book .
*MOT: we have alot of ones that are sim either those two we do have or ones that are similar so shes seen them .
*MOT: but she usually likes to look at books alot um .
*MOT: we read alot with our older son so um .
*MOT: I think she liked it because that but half the time she wants to eat the books so .
*MOT: so I know it its with my son it took us awhile xxx he eventually he would like just listen to the story and not eat the books but .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: I we realized yeah for awhile they just wanna eat so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: so would you say she prefers books ?
*MOT: at home Id say normally she prefers books because .
*MOT: I think because it involves um shes shes much more people oriented than our son was .
*MOT: and like my son wouldve been very happy to sit and play with toys for awhile .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and it took us a long time to actually get her to wanna play with toys alot longer than my son because she kept wanting to look at peoples faces .
*MOT: we sat her down to play with toys she just wanted to look at to look at us .
*MOT: so if we were reading a book I could put her on my lap and have my son over here and Id read her a book .
*MOT: and she could look at the book and look at the our face .
*MOT: um but toys shed sit down and just didnt .
*MOT: so finally .
*MOT: probably two months ago she started really liking getting the hang of toys .
*MOT: and now she finds them interest once she could sit up she um liked them alot more and she could sit with her brother .
*MOT: and she thought she just was the coolest thing because she could sit and play with her brother so .
*MOT: so normally Id say she likes probably books more than toys .
*MOT: um and some and when were all when its when I have my son and and her together shell shell sit and shell listen but today she just wanted to chew on them so .
*EXP: which did you xxx ?
*MOT: youknow she probably was the least interested in the stuffed animals .
*MOT: but she played with this too .
*MOT: she liked the frog for a little bit but then she just really wanted to play with the um all the play food .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: yeah I know .
*MOT: youknow I thought when I came out I said I thought she might like them because she liked faces alot so I didnt know if she would like them but .
*MOT: she was all about the food maybe shes hungry and trying to tell me .
*EXP: um do you think she recognizes any of the foods ?
*MOT: she .
*MOT: the only one that she might recognize would be peas .
*MOT: because shes eaten peas .
*MOT: the other ones shes not really eaten very much of .
*MOT: xxx xxx she was I wondered if I was wondering if shed recognize this one because this is what we ate for supper last night .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: so I didnt know if maybe thats why she gravitated to the spaghetti because she was getting noodles we were giving her little bits of noodles last night .
*EXP: mhm yeah .
*MOT: for supper so I dont know if its the peas and the spaghetti are the only ones that shes eat actually no actually no she probably she liked the bread to and shes had that .
*MOT: the foods that she picked are the ones that shes had and then a couple things she a couple other ones but most of the ones she spent the time with the peas and the spaghetti and and that xxx .
*EXP: do you have a doll xxx ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: um we have a doll .
*MOT: um it was my sons .
