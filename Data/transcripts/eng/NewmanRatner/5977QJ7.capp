*MOT: what do poodles say ?
*MOT: can you say woof woof ?
*MOT: yeah but dont bite it .
*MOT: doesnt taste very good .
*MOT: can you give a kiss ?
*EXP: alright um .
*EXP: so basically I wanted to ask what you thought she enjoyed the most out of the toys here .
*MOT: I was looking at that because I figured you were gonna ask me that and the t som the the toys that resemble food um she kept migrating towards the cookie .
*MOT: and the pizza .
*MOT: and the icecream cone .
*MOT: and those things she kept .
*MOT: like this one she she wouldnt wanna didnt wanna put this down .
*MOT: um until she picked up something else and then she kept going back to that one .
*MOT: and so she I think she really .
*MOT: but we we we like ColdstoneCreamery .
*MOT: so we go and take her sister to get icecream and she likes icecream so maybe that is why shes migrating towards the icecream cone .
*MOT: but I noticed the pizza and the cookie .
*MOT: and but anything else I was trying to force it on her and the spaghetti too .
*MOT: um she was messing with the spaghetti .
*MOT: the one that .
*MOT: she had one over here that looked a little bit more like spaghetti .
*MOT: but the ones that have the food .
*MOT: um here we go .
*MOT: um she wouldnt put these down .
*MOT: um this one because of the the weird texture of this .
*MOT: it was sitting here and she was playing with her the other stuff after xxx she had the keys .
*MOT: which she loves keys .
*MOT: I think all babies do .
*MOT: um but this one it moved on its own and it caught her eye .
*MOT: and she was like .
*MOT: I dont think I like that .
*MOT: and so then I moved it over here and she kept staring at it .
*MOT: and then she was like .
*MOT: okay I wanna touch it but I dont wanna touch it .
*MOT: so it was unknown to her and then like I would I would push it towards her and she showed fear .
*MOT: by moving away from it so I thought that was funny .
*MOT: and it was funny .
*MOT: um because we have a Kooshball .
*MOT: I dunno if you know what those are theyre but theyre theyre not as as .
*EXP: yeah yeah not as sticky as xxx .
*MOT: right and so they move a little bit more freely too because they dont stick .
*MOT: and um her sister is terrified of it .
*MOT: she wont touch it she wont pick up and I played an awful trick and threw it at her .
*MOT: and she laughed and picked it up .
*MOT: and she wasnt afraid of the Kooshball .
*MOT: but this I think because of the texture um not so much the color but the texture .
*MOT: shes drawn to it .
*EXP: well thats what I was gonna ask you next is why you thought she liked the certain things that she did like .
*EXP: some mothers think its color or texture .
*EXP: um and its interesting that you observed what happened when she saw that move by itself .
*MOT: yeah because even still now theyre like letting go of the the tentacles are letting go of each other .
*MOT: and um you cant control that so when its sitting there and it does it its like .
*MOT: wait a minute why did that move I wanna touch that .
*EXP: how about these other stuffed animals ?
*MOT: I just trying to get her to touch the stuffed animals and shed look at it but okay .
*MOT: p Pooh uh her Nanna loves Pooh so um shes she looked at it a little bit but .
*MOT: um so maybe because it was more familiar to her but the other stuffed animals no .
*MOT: she liked this one .
*MOT: she she put this one in her mouth I think it was because of the stripes .
*MOT: the striped hat .
*MOT: and the duck you know I go to give her a kiss and .
*MOT: eh nothing .
*MOT: but the baby .
*MOT: she did like the baby .
*MOT: and she was looked like she was trying to hug the baby .
*MOT: and I dont know if it was coincidence or not but she had the bottle in her hand .
*MOT: and um so when I gave her the baby she put the baby down picked up the bottle .
*MOT: put the bottle down .
*MOT: it looked like she was trying to coordinate her hands to to do whatever she wanted to do with the baby and the bottle .
*MOT: I dont think it was to feed it but I think she might associate the bottle with .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: now shes mainly breastfed um and its I stay at home with her now Im not um Im you know I took a year off from teaching to be with her .
*MOT: and so its very rare that she hasta be bottlefed unless I have um you know something I hafta do when shes with my mother .
*MOT: or her uh her n my mother in law .
*MOT: so theyll occasionally use a bottle but shes skipping straight to the bottle and going to the cup .
*MOT: but she didnt wanna play with this one .
*EXP: do you think she would recognize that as something familiar ?
*MOT: well yeah she shouldve because uh but maybe n maybe not with the top because shes shes busy she doesnt want the top she wants .
*MOT: xxx at her tongue .
*MOT: like you pick up a cup and she goes .
*MOT: thats xxx give me the cup .
*MOT: I dont want the bottle .
*MOT: I dont want anything .
*MOT: I want your cup .
*MOT: I want what you have in your cup .
*MOT: so um shes not but she put this in her mouth .
*MOT: she did definitely knew what this was so .
*EXP: that looked familiar .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: and some of the food you think may look familiar too ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: well w ca uh h her dad and uh sister had pizza the other night .
*MOT: um I do cook spaghetti so Im not sure if um its because its familiar .
*MOT: but she definitely keeps putting the food .
*MOT: nothing else really she was putting in her mouth .
*MOT: she didnt put the stuffed animals in her mouth .
*MOT: well she puts the keys in her mouth because thats what she does for everything all her play keys but .
*MOT: like nothing else youknow most of the time when shes trying to figure something out she puts it in her mouth .
*MOT: but mainly if it was a food toy she put the food and the toy in her mouth .
*MOT: she didnt put the .
*MOT: well she tried to eat the baby .
*MOT: and she keeps going to .
*MOT: and I think because the baby looks like her .
*MOT: youknow ?
*EXP: Im trying to get to know the baby .
*EXP: and was she interested in the books at all ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: no books .
*MOT: no even though we I read with her sister everyday you kn .
*MOT: mommy can you read this to me ?
*MOT: I wanna read to qwynniebear .
*MOT: and we uh youknow doing word recognition with her her sister .
*MOT: but shes not showing interest yet .
*EXP: so you would say that probably the books were the least interesting xxx today ?
*MOT: yeah yeah I I picked this one up and .
*MOT: nothing .
*MOT: youknow yeah she xxx too much other stuff going on .
*MOT: she wasnt really interested in it .
*MOT: I think she looked at it I think because of the colors .
*MOT: maybe the face on it but .
*MOT: but nothing else .
*MOT: um she did I was when I said I I recognized Id answered incorrectly .
*MOT: um Im not sure if I did or not but she actually picked the two up and was able to tap she tapped them together .
*MOT: and Im not sure if I answered that correctly on the que on the .
*EXP: als Ill look for it .
*MOT: yeah if shes able to tap them together .
*EXP: um and and then as far as the names of some of these things like the food .
*EXP: would do you think she would recognize names ?
*MOT: hm maybe maybe not .
*MOT: but I do you a you know whatever I do I always verbalize what Im doing .
*MOT: Im getting you a cup now .
*MOT: youknow I want her to develop lang her sis sister developed speaking very early and um .
*MOT: has none stop despite I think shh I think she has a stutter .
*MOT: um Im not sure .
*MOT: its because all kids do it at this age .
*MOT: trying their brain is working trying to figure out what they wanna say .
*MOT: but with her um Im probably more sensitive to it because her father has a stutter .
*MOT: and so I .
*MOT: you know Im just probably more on edge about it because .
*EXP: just give her some time .
*MOT: yeah when we have a very good friend whos a speech therapist .
*MOT: and um he said dont worry about it until shes four .
*MOT: if shes still doing that and um getting hung up on her like her w and her her y then um address it .
*MOT: but for now dont even worry about it and she has a lisp .
*MOT: but its just with s youknow like snake .
*EXP: shes young .
*MOT: and she is young and when I say Micah say ss and shell do it .
*MOT: she can do it .
*MOT: its just a matter of her being in such a hurry .
*EXP: right and shes probably useta do doing it the other way .
*MOT: mhm mhm so Im not g Im not worried about it .
*MOT: but um if Qwynn does the same thing you cant .
*MOT: I think stuttering hasta be hereditary .
*EXP: well they know now that that thats at least a component of it .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah it hasta be .
*MOT: because what are the odds .
*EXP: I just read in the paper about they identified some genes that um are related to stuttering .
*MOT: really ?
*EXP: still looking for some more but yeah but there are some genes that um contribute to stuttering .
*EXP: so we know that at least thats one factor .
*EXP: and maybe it takes more than that to to really cause a person to stutter .
*MOT: yeah I dont know my husband had a blood clot when he was a a baby .
*MOT: and they actually sent him home to .
*MOT: told his mom to make his arrangements .
*MOT: for burial because he wasnt going to make it .
*MOT: and one of the most intellectual people I know today .
*MOT: you cant tell me that he was sposta die .
*MOT: youknow ?
*MOT: but thats just um .
*MOT: and he and she says that thats where uh they say thats where the stuttering came from .
*MOT: and I dont think so .
*MOT: I think if youre tw .
*MOT: because it happened to him when he was eighteen months or two years old something like that .
*MOT: but if youre that young you havent even developed the speech yet .
*MOT: so how do you know ?
*MOT: youknow ?
*MOT: you you can say momma and dadda .
*MOT: which youknow ?
*MOT: but how do you know that you werent going to stutter before the blood clot ?
*MOT: you dont know and so Im just I just listen .
*MOT: yeah I file it away .
*EXP: youre smart you are thats exactly xxx .
*MOT: its one one battle Im not gonna fight .
*MOT: but I know as a mother you know and and as a teacher .
*MOT: because I teach sixth sixth grade and I taught fifth for several years and Ive come across my fair share of stuttering students .
*MOT: and um it does not hafta hinder their um cognitive abilities or their learning or youknow their even their participation in class .
*MOT: I just you know it doesnt hafta be that way .
*EXP: as long as they feel they dont feel ashamed .
*MOT: yeah it shouldnt be any .
*MOT: but um I think that um if if it comes down to it shes definitely in the right place youknow with you all I think .
*EXP: she is .
*MOT: and I put that on there so if you all come across any studies for Micahs age group that would be great too .
*MOT: you know just give us a call .
*MOT: well gladly bring her in .
*EXP: and if you do become concerned about like when shes four .
*EXP: you you have your friend so thats a resource .
*EXP: and if you ever wanted to get her evaluated here at the clinic they do that here too .
*MOT: oh .
*EXP: so um you can just make an appointment and have her evaluated .
*MOT: oh .
*EXP: we actually have um on the faculty here one of the I mean most well known people who work with stutterers .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: um and so she would be part of that evaluation .
*MOT: that would be good to know .
*MOT: thats good to know .
*EXP: yeah shes great yeah they have two um fluency groups that meet here that are adults um stutterers .
*MOT: oh .
*EXP: so theres a pretty strong .
*EXP: actually our department chair too is um her background is in fluency too .
*EXP: so so thats a very strong piece of the department here .
*EXP: so yeah but she your daughters young and but if you ever did wanna have her evaluated that you could come here .
*MOT: mhm yeah .
*MOT: yeah I will Ill keep that in mind .
*EXP: use your friend .
*MOT: well Charles is excellent .
*MOT: he he works with Howard at Howard university too so hes .
*EXP: yeah so there they probably have .
*MOT: yeah theyre not as extensive as Maryland I would imagine but um .
*EXP: yeah so you have you know what to do .
*MOT: definitely .
*MOT: oh yeah oh yeah .
*EXP: now as far as Qwynn um we have a lot of .
*EXP: hi .
*EXP: we have a lot of information that you um provided and were gonna ask you ea at each visit to fill out .
*EXP: and I know that a lot of it is gonna be the same but she will change over time so um youll see that .
*MOT: oh yeah shell grow and develop .
*EXP: each time we have a play session its gonna be these toys so well see if .
*MOT: if her interests change .
*EXP: mhm if her interests change if the way she explains the toys change .
*EXP: anything like that so itll be just like this .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: and um .
*MOT: and its over the course of four visits so that means shell be .
*EXP: shell be .
*EXP: this is the seven month visit then well do around ten months around eleven months and then at two years .
*EXP: and the two year visit is a little different .
*EXP: there will be a play session but theyll be some um some evaluations and assessments and then well be able to give you some information on her that way when shes two .
*EXP: thatll be fun .
*EXP: its fun to xxx xxx .
*MOT: yeah it is and to see the the change and the progression .
*EXP: alright well we are all done and I can take your microphone .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: doesnt taste very good .
*MOT: can you give a kiss ?
*MOT: give a kiss ?
*MOT: no ?
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: Im ready to ask you some questions .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: um well first of all what did she seem to like to play with ?
*MOT: well lets see here .
*MOT: the pizza .
*MOT: the pink icecream .
*MOT: not the white icecream .
*MOT: she liked the keys only after I gave them to her though .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: that that cup and then back to the bottle .
*MOT: this is like always a staple .
*MOT: so Im thinking .
*MOT: we recently have gotten into giving her the bottle .
*MOT: trying to wean her from breastfeeding .
*MOT: and so she sees th her bottle and gets excited .
*MOT: and maybe thats why shes uh youknow drawn to this one .
*EXP: she may recognize thats a bottle .
*MOT: mhm and she saw the liquid in there and shes trying to get to it .
*MOT: but its not real so she doesnt know that .
*MOT: but uh still she keeps going back to the bottle .
*MOT: out of all these toys the bottle .
*EXP: well shes showing her preference huh ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: but she did play with th a few other things .
*MOT: oh yeah um .
*MOT: she likes Pooh .
*MOT: again we have Pooh at home so she .
*MOT: but when I went to go give her the duck she .
