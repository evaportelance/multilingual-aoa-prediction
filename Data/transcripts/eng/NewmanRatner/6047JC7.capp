*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay lets see .
*EXP: which toys did he seem the most interested in ?
*EXP: definitely the play food .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: any items of the play food in particular ?
*MOT: uh the spoon .
*MOT: and the plate .
*EXP: why do you think that was ?
*MOT: um he likes to pick up objects and turn them in his hands I think those are like a good size for him .
*MOT: and they also um we dont have anything like that at home .
*MOT: so maybe its just youknow I mean we have spoons but we dont have like play food and play spoons for him .
*MOT: we mostly have like soft toys and books .
*MOT: and teethers .
*EXP: which toys did he seem the least interested in ?
*MOT: um Id say the soft toys .
*EXP: and why do you think that was ?
*MOT: um maybe just because theyre familiar or um .
*MOT: I dont think he sees them as something to play with yet maybe or they dont go in his mouth .
*MOT: he likes to put a lot of things in his mouth .
*MOT: so I think maybe the rubber kinda plastic feeling .
*MOT: he likes .
*EXP: um at home do you ever read books to him ?
*MOT: mhm yeah .
*EXP: I see it do you have any of these books ?
*MOT: um we have one like this that has where youknow he touches the animals .
*MOT: and we have goodnight moon at home .
*EXP: okay um would you say he prefers books over toys or toys over books ?
*MOT: um I think toys over books .
*MOT: like hell pay attention when we read bedtime stories and he seems youknow kinda interested but when hes awake during the day I think he prefers toys .
*EXP: do you think there are any items that he recognizes the names for ?
*MOT: uh I dont think so .
*EXP: from these which ones do you think hes never seen before what items do you think hes never seen before ?
*EXP: or heard before the names for ?
*MOT: um probably not like icecream cone pizza any of the foods um because we dont have play food and we just started him on solids so he only really knows youknow spoon .
*MOT: so those are probably new .
*EXP: um do you have any of the toys at home any of similar or same items I know you said you mentioned the book .
*MOT: yeah the books um and we have like a little soft toys but none of them are the same .
*EXP: are there some similar animals ?
*MOT: um we do have frogs .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and you say you dont have pretend food at home ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: what about dolls does he every play with dolls ?
