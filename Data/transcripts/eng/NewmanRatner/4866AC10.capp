*MOT: um we read this one .
*MOT: and she liked touching the the pieces .
*MOT: um she likes to turn pages too .
*EXP: do you have any books like those at home ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: that she might recognize ?
*MOT: yeah yeah yeah .
*MOT: yup and shes at home shes depending on how tired she is shes shell reach out and touch the pages .
*MOT: the more tired she is the more likely she is to wanna sit and read .
*MOT: otherwise she just wants to close it and then open it to a different page and close it and open it where she wants .
*EXP: do you think she recognizes the names of any of these toys ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: do you have any toys like this at home ?
*MOT: um we have keys at home .
*MOT: and shes got a bunch of stuffed animals .
*MOT: um we have plastic toys .
*MOT: um youknow like stacking cups and um various other things .
*MOT: and so thats probably why she was banging them .
*MOT: she likes to bang her toys at home .
*EXP: does she have any dolls at home ?
*MOT: no she doesnt .
*MOT: but were trying to youknow go over body parts with her and stuff .
