*EXP: thats interesting .
*MOT: I dunno why .
*MOT: that he kept these almost the entire time .
*MOT: then he would whack the baby on the head with them .
*MOT: so apparently thats what he really enjoyed to do .
*EXP: did he um does he have a baby at home ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: like a babydoll ?
*EXP: no ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: no hes got lots of he has uh like little animals but no babies .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: were a youknow a family of boys so we dont have babydolls .
*EXP: wow .
*MOT: dont you dare .
*MOT: you come here .
*EXP: does he um so how does he usually play with his other animals ?
*MOT: he usually gnaws on them .
*EXP: gnaws on them ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: was he doing that with uh these .
*MOT: yes he was everything goes in the mouth .
*MOT: so he usually eats anything and .
*MOT: we have a little one of those rubber like bracelet things .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: that is big enough that he can chew on it and it doesnt really and Im not too worried about him being able to chew through it .
*MOT: but everything he he chews everything .
*MOT: so we have a lot of hard toys that he chews on .
*MOT: and he likes to rip paper and eat that and .
*MOT: he has a couple electronic books that hell flip the pages and itll do like music and stuff .
*EXP: oh thats really neat .
*EXP: so I guess di how did he feel about books here ?
*MOT: not today .
*MOT: he when I was doing I was doing a peekaboo book and one of the little uh papers fell out .
*MOT: and then he got interested because it was something he could chew on .
*MOT: aw .
*EXP: so at home do you have the paper books do you use paper books ?
*MOT: not with him .
*MOT: uhuh no but his brothers have paper books .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: no wires .
*MOT: thats usually what we do when youre crawling around huh ?
*MOT: no wires .
*MOT: but we tried this one too and he touched it for an instant and then he was like yeah .
*MOT: then he was just like nope .
*MOT: more interested in the spaghetti thingies and banging them .
*EXP: is that typically what he does at home too ?
*EXP: more into toys than books or ?
*MOT: yeah for the most part until he realizes again that they make noise and then he likes to smack them and then they make noise some more so .
*EXP: was there anything um .
*EXP: has any of the books that you read do you think any of the words in it or the stories were familiar to him ?
*MOT: well I know like in this one weve got the uh they had ducks and the sheep and stuff and I think he knows that theyre animals .
*MOT: if nothing else .
*MOT: so weve been to a farm before and so they hes seen them before .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but I dunno if he really understands like what they are .
*MOT: but I was just trying to get him to touch the soft .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: because we have cats at home and and theyre soft too huh ?
*MOT: when youre nice to them .
*EXP: how about the Peekababy boo book ?
*MOT: we do peekaboo at home .
*MOT: but not with a book .
*MOT: but we do peekaboo and uh he seems to hes starting to understand that youre still there .
*MOT: so he starts to look around the hands looking for so .
*EXP: aw .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: oh now youre gonna find other things huh ?
*MOT: whats that ?
*MOT: xxx bee ?
*EXP: how about the foods is are has he tried these foods or are these any of these foods that you played with today or that you talked about are they foods that youve had at home ?
*MOT: he has had um spaghetti type things at home but not they dont look like this .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but hes seen us eat it .
*MOT: um Im just not were just not there yet with him .
*MOT: with the these particular like actual .
*MOT: but hes eaten bread before which is why I was kinda surprised he didnt go for the bread .
*EXP: did you bring did you present it to him ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yeah I put them I put some something on it .
*MOT: and he just was like whatever .
*MOT: and then he did the same thing that I .
*MOT: I put plates down too because I feed him like green beans and stuff on plates and and he didnt want his spaghetti on the plate .
*MOT: so he took it right back off .
*MOT: huh ?
*MOT: thats what you did .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: how about any other foods that um you tried to introduce to him or um that might be familiar .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: that he picked up ?
*MOT: nope just he was more interested in .
*MOT: well hes got the peas now it looks like .
*MOT: hes had peas before .
*MOT: actual peas he likes to squish them .
*EXP: oh yeah .
*MOT: but um but yeah no the only things that he was picking up were the the spaghetti .
*MOT: that was it .
*MOT: oh now youre gonna use the spoon huh ?
*EXP: so today was his first time kinda playing with baby and doing things with baby ?
*MOT: well he did that the last time too .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: he noticed the baby the last time also .
*MOT: and was interested .
*MOT: but he plays with his shadow in the window and in the mirror so .
*MOT: and uh so hes he sees himself and so he knows hes Joe and he knows what he looks like .
*MOT: so I think that seeing the baby doll is enough of a lookalike th for him .
*MOT: huh ?
*EXP: so do you um what did you notice any differences from his the first time he came and played with these toys ?
*MOT: well he seemed to not be as interested in as many things .
*MOT: it seemed last time he was more willing to look at other things that I youknow showed him .
*MOT: and this time he had more of an idea of this is what I want and so this is what Im going to do .
*EXP: oh thats funny .
*MOT: but he also wasnt mobile last time and so hes mobile now .
*MOT: and so at home usually its youknow the wires its always wires with him .
*MOT: he takes after his father .
*MOT: huh ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: are you gonna talk to the baby ?
*MOT: yeah ?
*EXP: has he had peanutbutter ?
*MOT: uhuh .
*EXP: no ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: but he I think he liked the fact that it rolled .
*EXP: mm okay .
*MOT: because I I put it up and he bangs on things so I gave him this and banged on it and hes like no not gonna bang on it today .
*MOT: huh ?
*EXP: how about any differences between do you have any of these toys at home ?
*MOT: just Imean we have a variety of st the stuffed animals but again he wasnt really interested in the stuffed animals .
*MOT: but he did I think recognize the bear .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: because we have lots of bears at home .
*MOT: and so I think that was something he he recognized but yeah .
*MOT: the rest of it yeah he wasnt he was more interested in these .
*MOT: things he can shove in his mouth and .
*EXP: that makes sense .
*MOT: things he can chew on .
*MOT: hes got five teeth and he puts them to good use .
*EXP: um do you think that hes got any um attraction to color ?
*EXP: like um for example the peas are green and the frog is green and .
*EXP: um just some things that hes been um were there any trends across color ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: not really .
*MOT: I dont think .
*MOT: its youknow he well hes going for red things now it looks like so maybe hes more interested in red .
*MOT: but his brothers have uh favorite colors are red and blue right now .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so we have a lot of red and blue things .
*MOT: so but even at home when he has a when he notices his bib and whats on his bib he has a tendency to if its colorful .
*MOT: like we have Elmo ones .
*MOT: he seems to play with the bib more than he wants to eat .
*EXP: okay yeah .
*MOT: so its very possible that he likes red .
*EXP: I just wanted to I always ask parents if its you think its the noise its the texture or the color youknow thats really making them gravitate towards particular toys .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um across the different toys .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah I dont think so .
*MOT: Imean hes now hes more interested just in food in general it looks like .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: he uses his feet a lot like that .
*MOT: its so funny .
*MOT: he pulls things closer to him with his feet .
*EXP: with his feet ?
*MOT: hell hell kick and kick and kick and hes realized that things will come closer to him sometimes .
*MOT: its really funny to watch him .
*MOT: huh ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um is there anything um that you noticed that was different um this time that you wanna add ?
*EXP: I know we kind of talked about it .
*EXP: this time xxx from how he plays at home ?
*MOT: thats funny because when we play at home honestly we dont usually when Im with him I dont usually play with like the toys .
*MOT: we have a basket of things that he can youknow go and play with whenever he wants to and he goes and he youknow picks everything out and knocks the bu the basket over and stuff .
*MOT: but he and I we we throw you in the air and .
*MOT: huh ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: weve been working on his crawling more and his standing on his own and and things .
*MOT: but yeah he hes pretty good at just finding things .
*EXP: entertaining himself a little bit ?
*MOT: pretty much yeah .
*MOT: hes he doesnt need me which has been a help .
*EXP: thats great .
*MOT: every so often he gets it in his head that he really needs me but for the most part hes pretty independent .
*MOT: I think its because of his brothers because his brothers really entertain him .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and Im not I think Im not as interesting as they are .
*EXP: well theyre smaller ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: right ?
*MOT: a little bit smaller yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: theyre six but .
*MOT: but yeah theyre shorter the .
*MOT: and they tend to uh not pay as much attention to him sometimes and so hes he gets into more things when theyre around than when I am .
*EXP: oh no .
*MOT: Im just surprised he hasnt gone after the wires more .
*MOT: because thats his favorite thing to do .
*MOT: go after wires pull them up pull them chew on them .
*MOT: huh ?
*MOT: that is your favorite thing to do at home .
*MOT: pull on wires .
*MOT: thats too big for you .
*MOT: thats too big .
*EXP: so um I think thats it .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: for this portion .
*MOT: the theme for today is things I can put in my mouth and chew .
*EXP: okay so I just wanna ask you some questions about what you did .
*EXP: um I noticed you playing a lot with the food .
*EXP: which items did he uh like ?
*MOT: oh well he was eating the peas the both this main spaghetti .
