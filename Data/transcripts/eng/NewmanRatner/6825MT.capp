*EXP: this study were actually just trying to get um so see the childrens babble over time .
*EXP: as their language are changing and how theyre responding to the different toys .
*EXP: so we use the same set of toys over and over again .
*MOT: oh .
*EXP: so we kind of compare um amongst themselves like each child amongst themselves over time .
*EXP: and see how theyre developing and if their speech pattern kinda changes .
*EXP: um and then the next visit after this one the two year visit we actually do articulation and speech and language testing .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: um and we see if like that trend that development has anything to do um the way this child developed and the next child developed and those types of things .
*MOT: oh okay .
*EXP: so well have over a hundred fifty kids at the termination of the project .
*EXP: to see so a lot some of the kids um have been coming back with like speech and language difficulties and see if theres anything early on based on the laboratory skills that were doing in there as well as the babbling that were seeing in here and the way that theyre playing really interacting with the toys .
*EXP: if theres something early on that we can see that points to um a learning .
*MOT: a learning disability .
*EXP: right a learning disability .
*MOT: oh okay that makes sense .
*MOT: no with McKayla shes just um shes much more active today than she was last time .
*MOT: I was wondering what will it take to get to that xxx .
