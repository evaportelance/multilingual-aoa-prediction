*MOT: sure .
*EXP: ah what did you all play with first ?
*MOT: I think she picked up the frog first .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: after the frog what else did she play with ?
*MOT: a cookie .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and then the pizza slices I think .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: keep going ?
*EXP: yeah go ahead .
*MOT: oh just should I just list everything ?
*EXP: yeah that would really be helpful .
*MOT: I dont remember at all exactly in the order that she played but um .
*MOT: uh the plastic spoons .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: the waffle pieces .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um I thought that she would like the puppet but she seemed less interested in the puppet today .
*EXP: did she recognize that xxx ?
*MOT: who .
*EXP: xxx the puppet .
*MOT: the kangaroo ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: do I recognize it ?
*EXP: does she recognize it ?
*MOT: I dont think so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: I dont think um she seems she likes a lot of puppet things which is why I thought shed be into it .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: but um maybe shes not interested in the stuffed animals actually because we dont really give her stuffed animals to play with .
*MOT: just because we have cats and the cats have stuffed animals .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and it helps to delineate between what is a cat toy and what is a people toy or the cats get very confused about what theyre allowed to carry around with them so .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: there you now you like the puppet but you dont actually want me to puppet with it huh no .
*MOT: um she really likes the plastic food pieces and the spoon .
*MOT: uh and she wants well she wants to chew on everything because she hasnt gotten her first tooth yet .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: aw .
*MOT: um and shes been working on it for like months .
*MOT: so uh it should be here soon right ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: does she have pretend food at home ?
*MOT: uh no .
*MOT: she does not .
*MOT: we have like a lot of sea creatures for some reason .
*MOT: everyone gave us sea creatures as like toys .
*MOT: ah so we have lots of octopuses and sea horses and things .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: well and then like all that Fisherprice stuff is all baby animals so theres lots of baby animals .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: this is spaghetti now youre playing with the spaghetti you didnt like the spaghetti before .
*EXP: what other food to have does does she play with ?
*MOT: uh well she played with like multiple pieces of pizza at once .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and then the plates .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: but she didnt do she I think she cause she likes the smaller ones she didnt really seem interested in like the big ones .
*MOT: I didnt offer her them but she didnt really seem interested .
*MOT: and like the this was like kinda heavy I think for her so she now now you want it .
*MOT: youre strange sometimes .
*MOT: oh .
*MOT: what you trying to put that in your mouth ?
*EXP: do you think she um recognizes what whats in that cup ?
*MOT: ah yeah I dunno if she recognizes whats in it .
*MOT: but the sippy cup she definitely seemed cause she didnt she tried to like suck on it .
*MOT: and she has a sippy cup which she sucks on .
*MOT: um she also she feeds herself at home .
*MOT: so um but I dont think that she was like trying to eat the food I think shes just too busy trying to put everything in her mouth because thats what she does .
*MOT: but the sippy cup it did seem like she was like trying to actually use it as a sippy cup .
*MOT: as opposed to like the bottle when she picked up she was like chewing on the nipple of the bottle .
*MOT: but thats because shes never really used a bottle she kinda went straight to the sippy cup .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: ah cause I nurse her so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: uh now youre like Godzilla .
*MOT: you rolling around in the stuff roar oh yeah she wants this wire .
*MOT: she really likes wires and tries to chew on all the wires at home .
*EXP: thats interesting .
*MOT: well .
*MOT: her father and I are both have like multiple laptops in the living room and so shes constantly scooting over to where like the power adapters are so .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um she has her own private usb cable that shes allowed to chew on instead of our power cables because Id rather have her chew on something thats not hooked up to anything .
*MOT: right see .
*MOT: you dont even care say what is that thing ?
*MOT: thats a baby doll .
*MOT: but you dont have any baby dolls and yeah .
*MOT: it has very cute shoes though .
*EXP: what stuffed animals did she play with ?
*MOT: I thought shed like the the word world ones but she just mostly the frog .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: the sea otter she seemed to think is that what it is was cute .
*MOT: the keys uh she liked the keys .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: you picked this one up these were xxx ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah but she didnt I dunno .
*MOT: didnt seem that interested in them so .

*MOT: youre licking that babys head .
*EXP: um has she seen this toy before ?

*MOT: you dont have Pooh but you know Eeyore .
*EXP: and has she seen these animals before xxx if this is the word but .
*MOT: uh weve watched watched that show a couple times but mostly shes hardcore into sesame street so .
*MOT: I think if you had had like big bird or something she would really recognize that .
*MOT: shes really likes and um oh theres a character on sprout this chicken that like she gets visibly excited when she sees this particular chicken .
*MOT: it has a squeaker in it and it goes like coo and then she gets like really excited if its even an advertisement for it .
*MOT: um but they dont merchandise things so .
*MOT: what youre poking that babys eye out .
*MOT: what are you doing ?
*EXP: with the books uh do you read with her do you read to her at home ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: um but typically I dont like have her like sitting on my lap because she chews the board books and like destroys the board books so .
*MOT: uh we try to give her something else and then read with her .
*MOT: you know because they after like five minutes of it being chewed the whole board book starts to like come apart .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so we have a cloth book that we we have cloth books so that that shes allowed to play with because that actually like maintains .
*MOT: right you chew on cloth books .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: there was one book you tried to read to her .
*MOT: mhm .
