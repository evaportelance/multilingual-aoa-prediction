*CHI: here here Devon .
*EXP: xxx to Devon .
*MOT: you gonna take them to Devon ?
*EXP: here you go .
*EXP: you mind if I start asking you some questions ?
*MOT: sure .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay what do you think um she liked to play with the most ?
*MOT: I think she loves noise makers .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and uh yeah she seems to be really into the spoon which looks a lot like the kinda spoon she would eat from so that doesnt really surprise me .
*MOT: um and yeah she just likes to make little noises .
*MOT: and pick things up and see if they make soft sounds or loud sounds .
*MOT: shell experiment with that stuff at home so .
*MOT: thats not surprising is it ?
*EXP: is it similar to what she played with last time ?
*MOT: it I cant remember exactly what she played with last time .
*MOT: I know last time she liked the measuring spoons .
*MOT: um but she always seems to gravitate toward the kinda food lou louder harder kinda toys and stuff .
*MOT: this was funny to me because since weve been here last she drinks more out of a sippy cup .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so youknow this I know this is a sippy cup but I wouldnt necessarily think thered be enough things that would make her think oh I should do this and put this in my mouth .
*MOT: and we dont drink anything bright orange for instance we dont have a little tiny thing .
*MOT: hers all have little handles and the spouts different .
*MOT: but it was interesting to me that she understood thats a mini sippy cup and Im going to put it in my mouth and see if anything comes out .
*MOT: so thats kinda funny to me .
*EXP: was there something that you tried to play with with her that she was absolutely not interested in ?
*MOT: the books .
*MOT: youknow she seemed like she had enough going on that she didnt really care about the books .
*MOT: and like this stuff was interesting but only in so much as can I make it make a noise when I hit it with a spoon .
*MOT: and if I cant okay then Im moving back to my loud toys .
*MOT: so I think that she was kind of again gravitating toward the the food plastic kind of clanky sounding stuff .
*EXP: what were some of the animal names that are familiar to her ?
*MOT: um dog .
*MOT: certainly dog maybe not poodle .
*MOT: but dog .
*MOT: um we do talk about a goose but not that much .
*MOT: um the ones shes really familiar with actually arent really here .
*MOT: like we talk more about kind of the farm animal stuff .
*MOT: like the animals that would be in here she hears about a lot .
*MOT: frog .
*MOT: she hears frog .
*EXP: what were the animals in that book that ?
*MOT: definitely like uh duck lamb or sheep horse cow a lot of and pig .
*MOT: I mean pretty much all these sort of farm animals are ones that she hears a lot .
*MOT: she has like a little play farm and then she has books that have the farm animals and we have a puzzle thats a farm puzzle .
*MOT: so it seems like we just have a lot of stuff that lends itself to being talked about .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so she hears the sounds and we make the sounds and she plays with the different things .
*MOT: what is that ?
*EXP: and at home um does she um does she prefer toys over books as well ?
*MOT: its funny itll just kinda depend .
*MOT: um she she definitely likes being read to .
*MOT: and shes and we build that into her day .
*MOT: but I think she would prefer to be on the move right now .
*MOT: so reading is kinda like were reading to her and shes playing .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and then reading is like before a nap or before bed .
*MOT: youknow shes more willing to sit on our laps and and read for a while .
*MOT: and then sometimes youknow shell be cuddled up and kinda quieter and we can read for a long time .
*MOT: so it it totally depends but she will mostly if shes in play mode books are not gonna do it for her .
*MOT: shes gonna wanna be like moving .
*EXP: does she like certain books over other books ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: yeah ?
*MOT: definitely .
*MOT: if its a book that like she normally will like things like this that have flaps and shell do the flaps after I do them .
*MOT: she definitely prefers like some of the books we have at home shell youknow kind of while were reading it shell do this and then shell turn the page herself .
*MOT: um shes not into long stories .
*MOT: Imean what you would kind of expect .
*MOT: faces real faces real pictures seem to be something shes more into .
*MOT: and then we have these Helen Oxberry books this like set of four books that are just really sweet really simple and they are all youknow illustrated theyre not pictures .
*MOT: but its just real simple messages and theyre big baby faces that are doing things like clapping or tickling or theres a good night book .
*MOT: and she likes that .
*MOT: shell sit and look for a long time which .
*MOT: when we first got these books like they have a total of like eight words in the whole book .
*MOT: and Im like how is this a book ?
*MOT: how is my kid gonna like this ?
*MOT: I dont like this .
*MOT: and its actually its some of our favorite stuff to do .
*MOT: because it really just kind of cuts it down to the simple youknow like up down up in the sky .
*MOT: youknow swing low swing high .
*MOT: bumpity bumpity hold on tight .
*MOT: hush little baby say goodnight .
*MOT: and thats the whole book .
*MOT: but its like she loves it and so we love it .
*EXP: she is just looking at you .
*MOT: yeah I know like hey I know that .
*MOT: she likes her GoodnightMoon .
*MOT: we read that .
*MOT: so just nothing thats like long or like we really havent gotten into DoctorSeuss she doesnt seem to like as much yet .
*EXP: thats too a little bit longer ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: longer story and maybe just not as interesting for her to connect with or something I dunno .
*EXP: what are some of the foods that might be familiar to her ?
*EXP: um in that you played with or ?
*MOT: well definitely cheese .
*MOT: we youknow will have a snack of a of like pieces of of a slice of cheese .
*MOT: um the peas .
*MOT: uh certainly bread youknow .
*MOT: little pieces of bread .
*MOT: or waffle .
*MOT: probably not so much icecream we dont really eat that at home .
*MOT: she doesnt really see that .
*MOT: pizza maybe .
*MOT: um and I have no idea what some of these things are so .
*MOT: I wouldnt be really familiar .
*MOT: but we dont do a lot of desserts .
*MOT: so nothing desserty .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but certainly in the last couple months shes gotten a lot more into youknow we eat a lot more solid foods and baby foods now .
*EXP: how about juices ?
*MOT: no juice but we do uh water in the sippy cup and milk .
*MOT: um so she would be familiar with probably those kind of drinks .
*MOT: but nothing like that looks co like it has color to it .
*MOT: that would probably just look like something funny .
*MOT: Im sure youd figure out to try to drink it because it was liquid .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: how about um babydolls ?
*EXP: does she have dolls at home or how did she fare with this babydoll here ?
*MOT: she that baby doll doesnt really look anything like what she has she has kinda soft babies .
*MOT: um a couple of them are sposta look human .
*MOT: one is like a funny yarn flower kind of doll .
*MOT: we have more stuffed animals now in the crib because we found that shes more into them .
*MOT: um and she has like a big bunny thats really funny that has different sensory kind of noises it makes and things it can do and she will kiss that and hug that and like talk to that and the same thing with this little like OneHundredAndOneDalmatian doll thats at our house .
*MOT: that she really gets into .
*MOT: but not so much anything that looks like a real baby I dont think she gets that as much yet .
*MOT: its just like a soft cuddly little thing at this point .
*EXP: are you doing like body parts and ?
*MOT: yes we weve done that um weve got some books that have that we have some rhymes we do and then we do were doing more like the songs .
*MOT: like han youknow head shoulders knees and toes .
*MOT: were doing that more .
*MOT: we have these little rhymes that we do with her .
*MOT: so were doing body parts more and she seems to I dont know if Im just projecting on her that shes getting it more but like if Ill say wheres the bunnys ears and she grabs the ears I just assume thats real youknow .
*MOT: whereas really it could just be that she likes the ears because they make a good sound .
*MOT: but shes definitely like in the last month Ive noticed a real growth spurt in terms of what she understands what she seems to be following and doing and what she associates with like the sound of the front door opening even if were upstairs shell immediately start crawling because she knows somebodys either coming or going .
*MOT: and before she didnt really seem to connect that as much .
*MOT: and uh if we say wheres Mommy wheres Daddy youknow shell look for us .
*MOT: she says Dada now .
*EXP: aw .
*MOT: she says nana which sometimes means I think Im sleepy nightnight and sometimes I think means Im hungry because she associates being fed with like sleep .
*MOT: so shes starting to um do more labeling but definitely more youknow understanding of language and I think some of that if Im like youre pulling on Mommys hair shell laugh and kind of pull more .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so I think shes kind of getting some of that .
*MOT: maybe ?
*MOT: I dunno .
*MOT: maybe Im just projecting .
*MOT: but she certainly is just like in front of my eyes seems more aware of things that are going on .
*MOT: its harder to trick her or get something past her .
*MOT: youknow like if she sees something she wants and before she even gets there if I have like real quickly put it away it useta be that she would just kind be like oh thats weird I thought I knew that was there .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: now she looks at me and just knows .
*MOT: I saw that .
*MOT: and shell start crawling around behind me until she finds it .
*MOT: and then shes like yeah I know .
*MOT: I knew that was there .
*MOT: dont even try to pull that past me anymore .
*MOT: so like the blackberry the remote controls the phones in the house .
*MOT: those are all really hard to sneak away anymore if she sees it its like over .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: but its funny because I filled out that paper work .
*MOT: and and we have a nanny whos home with her like three to four days a week .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and so I like to youknow partner with her on this stuff .
*MOT: and I want her to feel a vested interest in Rosies development and language and all this stuff .
*MOT: so I always leave the paperwork with her and Im like hey lets talk about this when when I get home .
*MOT: like tell me if you agree or disagree with anything I put .
*MOT: so youknow the first time she was kind of like didnt really do it .
*MOT: the second time she was like I think she does this and Im like okay and then we youknow we looked at or whatever .
*MOT: and then the next day I said hey theres some things I didnt fill out why dont you try these with her and see if she likes them like putting a cheerio in the in the bottle and see if shell go for it .
*MOT: and so she got really excited about it .
*MOT: the nanny was like this is cool .
*MOT: so she was doing it and talking to me .
*MOT: so this time I said okay heres all the paperwork let me know and when I got home shes like you totally underestimate your daughter .
*EXP: aw .
*MOT: shes like there is so much on here that she knows and does and Im like really ?
*MOT: shes like yes .
*MOT: she knows her stroller she knows diaper she knows .
*MOT: Im like she does ?
*MOT: shes like yeah I mean Abby shes like every single day I say to the kids okay were gonna go to the stroller and they crawl to the top .
*MOT: and shes like now maybe theyre just associating that with leaving but they know stroller means something .
*MOT: and if I hand Rosie youknow if I say diaper shell crawl over to me .
*MOT: or if she thinks Im gonna change it shell run away but she gets it .
*MOT: so it was so funny because I was like oh okay .
*MOT: so we went through this and and the nanny was so proud of herself because she was like right .
*MOT: Rosie does know alot more than I have associated her with knowing .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so that was like both humbling like hm your nanny hasta tell you about your kid .
*MOT: but it was also a good reminder that sometimes I think were so useta what they dont know .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: that we dont pick up the clues when they get it .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: so thats kinda been a a mommy epiphany I think .
*EXP: well you also said that you um you werent sure you were projecting on her so you never know we use this all the time I dont know if she knows the word or knows the routine youknow so .
*MOT: right exactly .
*EXP: uh its hard .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: so its certainly shes picking things up and shes getting shes getting that figured out .
*MOT: I sometimes worry because the other little boy in the nanny share is fifteen months .
*MOT: and he doesnt really have any language yet .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um and youknow were a good four months behind him but shes not around a a kid whos like talking to her or engaging with her .
*MOT: and so thats why we really stress that we want the grownups who are around her to be creating a really language rich environment .
*MOT: because youknow the the little boy Imean the parents are kinda worried about it and they might start doing just like looking into if theres anything cognitive there they needta be thinking about but .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: hes so advanced motor skills wise that I dont think they really worry about it .
*MOT: and then all the sudden its like okay but hes still not saying anything okay but hes still saying anything and .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: well see .
*EXP: um they can get youknow checked out uh see what they say through the infants and toddlers program in their county .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: were in d c I dont even know if we have one .
*MOT: I feel like d c is kind of .
*EXP: I dunno either .
*MOT: but but theyre both doctors so I think theyve theyve looked into what kinda like first steps kinda thing would be around that they could look at .
*EXP: he could just be a late talker .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: you know ?
*EXP: all of the sudden hell string a phrase together .
*MOT: I know .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: well that would be really cool .
*MOT: she is doing more like signs which is kinda fun .
*MOT: like shell do more .
*MOT: and shell do milk .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: oh .
*MOT: when she was sick she like went on a food strike for fifteen hours like she wouldnt eat she wouldnt .
*MOT: and I was kind of like worried about it and we were getting ready to go to the doctor just to check it out .
*MOT: and she was crying and she did the milk sign and I was like youre telling Mommy that you do wanna eat now youre hungry .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and she came right over and she nursed and I was like oh my god this is a language breakthrough .
*MOT: Rosie just told me what she wanted with out more than crying .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: just like the first year it seems like its just crying and you determine the cry .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: whats in there ?
*MOT: is that the horsie ?
*MOT: do you feel the horsie ?
*MOT: is that the lamb ?
