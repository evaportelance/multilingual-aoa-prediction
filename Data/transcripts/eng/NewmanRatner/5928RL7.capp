*MOT: What do you think ?
*MOT: she seemed to like this stuffed animal with these guys .
*MOT: but in general .
*MOT: she didnt seem to go for any other stuffed animals .
*MOT: she likes more of the stuff she can make noises with .
*MOT: that has some more .
*MOT: kind of plastic .
*MOT: crunches and stuff .
*EXP: Do you think that she is familiar with the names of the animals ?
*MOT: of those ?

*MOT: otters dont really come up .
*MOT: goslings and fawns no .
*EXP: how about the food is she eating or using a spoon to eat ?

*MOT: when I feed her and .
*MOT: sometimes we will give her own spoon .
*MOT: um and for food .
*MOT: xxx you know none of this food is similar to what she eats .
*EXP: visually similar .
*MOT: um we have never had ice cream cones in front of her .
*MOT: um we have eaten sandwiches and stuff .
*MOT: but I dont think I dont think any of these look visually enough like we eat for her .
*MOT: for her to make that connection .
*MOT: xxx cheese though .
*MOT: she has seen us eat a lot of cheese slices .
*MOT: and lately we have been giving her little bits of that .
*MOT: so that would probably be the one most similar .
*EXP: does she play with baby dolls at home ?

*MOT: or pull it off herself .
*MOT: and we say peekaboo so thats a fun game .
*MOT: yeah I know .
*MOT: you wanna be up .
*MOT: well one thing that I notice whenever she is somewhere new with new toys .
*MOT: she will kind of sit .
*MOT: and observe for a while .
*MOT: you know she will she will get whats near her .
*MOT: but she kinda is an observer in the beginning .
*MOT: she will get comfortable and familiar .
*MOT: and then she will start to verbalize or vocalize .
*MOT: kind of get interested and going a little farther .
*MOT: to get stuff .
*MOT: but at home where she knows most of the toys .
*MOT: when we set her down .
*MOT: she just starts going you know .
*MOT: so as we get as we go for playdates places and stuff .
*MOT: in the beginning she will just sort of sit and hold court .
*MOT: and look around .
*MOT: maybe reach for something or play with what you give her .
*MOT: and be very quiet .
*MOT: and then she will start .
*MOT: kind of getting a little more expressive .
*MOT: so I think this held .
*MOT: true to that that she kind of sat and .
*MOT: looked around and found something nearby like the bee .
*MOT: and then when she got a little bit more comfortable then she would go find other stuff .
*MOT: she wanted yeah yeah yeah .
*MOT: but lately especially as shes kind of .
*MOT: in the last few weeks .
*MOT: hit this kind of milestone of getting more comfortable crawling .
*MOT: going up to standing lately .
*MOT: thats been more entertaining to her .
*MOT: its like toys dont even hafta be there .
*MOT: if she can just crawl on you .
*MOT: stand up .
*MOT: pull on stuff .
*MOT: its like everything except her toys will interest her .
