*EXP: um were there which group of toys did he seem to like ?
*MOT: the food .
*EXP: the food ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: oh okay .
*EXP: what about the least ?
*MOT: um the stuffed animals .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and I dont know if you remember .
*EXP: but do you think that changed ?
*MOT: the last time he also liked the toys .
*MOT: and I .
*MOT: or the food .
*MOT: and I think it hasta do with the fact that its the most um the easiest for him to chew on because hes teething like he was last time .
*MOT: so the last time he chose the pea .
*MOT: like I just think the shape of them .
*MOT: its easy for him to hold and to gnaw on .
*MOT: because I know he doesnt know what spaghetti .
*MOT: Imean Im pretty sure he doesnt know what spaghetti is .
*MOT: hes never had spaghetti so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: ah did he did he go to the books at all ?
*MOT: he didnt .
*MOT: um Imean I tried to read them to him .
*MOT: I think .
*MOT: at home he tends to we read a lot .
*MOT: um Ive been surprised that when were here hes not interested in the books .
*MOT: but it might just be because theres other toys here that hes not familiar with .
*EXP: um do you guys have any of these at home ?
*MOT: we have um we have the put me in the zoo .
*MOT: and we have no we dont have we have the regular goodnight moon .
*MOT: not goodnight moon one two three .
*MOT: this book um grammy h grandma has at her house .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: um does he have similar toys at home ?
*MOT: um he h Imean he has books .
*MOT: he has stuffed animals .
*MOT: he doesnt have any food toys .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: um no .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: although the one thing I was surprised by was that he picked this up and tried to drink outta it .
*MOT: because were were transitioning him to a bottle at night before bed .
*MOT: and so he it took him a long time to get adjusted to that .
*MOT: but now he obviously knows what it is because he was trying to get the liquid out haha .
*EXP: okay haha .
*EXP: um so you said he l .
*MOT: what do ya doing ?
*EXP: toys or books that ah he likes .
*MOT: at home I would say hed prefers his toys .
*MOT: um Imean we generally use books kind of as a winddown thing before naptime or bedtime .
*MOT: what do ya doing with the peas ?
*EXP: I think you said he doesnt know what spaghetti he never had spaghetti before .
*MOT: no no .
*EXP: would he recognize any of the other foods ?
*MOT: Imean Im not sure because when when he gets peas we give them like th we give him like three or four peas at a time .
*MOT: and thats not really what this looks like .
*MOT: so Im not k completely sure .
*MOT: he eats cheese all the time .
*MOT: but again we give it to him in little tiny pieces .
*MOT: um so Im not sure that he would associate this with a piece of cheese .
*MOT: um obviously he did know what the s .
*MOT: well I think he knew what the spoon was .
*MOT: although he tried to brush his hair with it .
*MOT: um youknow it seemed like he knew that the spoon went in his mouth .
*MOT: but for the most part all of the food he gets at this point is still cut up into little .
*MOT: waffles too .
*MOT: Imean Ive given him waffles before .
*MOT: but it comes out of the toaster .
*MOT: and I cut it up .
*MOT: and then I give him three pieces at a time .
*MOT: so I dont know that he knows that this is what hes eating .
*EXP: okay right haha .
*EXP: ah would he recognize any of the animals ?
*EXP: do you think ?
*MOT: huh um Imean he knows dogs .
*MOT: but Im not sure that he knew that this was a dog .
*MOT: Im not sure I would know thats a dog .
*EXP: kinda like a cat .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: so that would probably be the one .
*MOT: hes really into mice these days .
*MOT: but I dont think theres any mice here .
*MOT: so no probably not .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: oop Im sorry .
*MOT: did you lose the peas ?
*EXP: okay I think that should be .
*EXP: is there anything else the way he plays at home that you wanna tell us ?
*MOT: um whoa .
*MOT: no Imean th his favorite thing these days and probably for the last month or two has been a ball .
*MOT: and so Im sure if there was a ball in the mix thats what he wouldve been obsessed with the whole time .
*EXP: okay um I think thats it then .
*MOT: alright .
*MOT: what do ya doing buddy ?
