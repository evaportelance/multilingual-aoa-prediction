*MOT: Sofia has ever .
*MOT: that we mightve just gotten that for Emma I cant remember .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um and we have GoodNightMoon but we dont have that size GoodNightMoon .
*MOT: but we dont have any of the other things here .
*EXP: um so do you think that she may have recognized any of the toys ?
*MOT: I dont think so .
*MOT: Imean .
*MOT: maybe oh and we have other stuffed animals so maybe she would think that they look similar but theyre not like the same as these .
*MOT: I dont think she recognizes them .
*EXP: and then specifically um what toys do you think that she was most interested in ?
*MOT: I think she liked the hard plastic stuff alot .
*MOT: because she likes to put it in her mouth and chew on it she seemed to like the keys .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and I guess those little um apple juice things in the little sippycup .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and the doll .
*EXP: and then do uh do you and your child read books at home ?
*MOT: we do but um like I said she usually just grabs it from me and eats it .
*MOT: so um we dont get very far I usually just get to the first page and then shell start crying if I keep if I try and keep going instead of letting her just have the book .
*EXP: do you think that she would prefer to play with books or toys ?
*MOT: I think she probably I think toys .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: um do you think any of the stuffed animals interested her ?
*MOT: not really .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: Imean we have stuffed animals at home and um .
*MOT: she uh likes them kindof but she mostly likes hard plastic toys .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: um and then I guess specifically of the her plastic toys which ones do you think .
*MOT: she liked the pizza slice and the waffle .
*MOT: looks like maybe she likes that cheese .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and uh that sippycup thing .
*MOT: that one with the doll I guess .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: um and then I noticed that you did point out some of the stuffed animals do you think shes maybe seen them on tv or .
*MOT: well .
*EXP: or just mainly because you knew them .
*MOT: yeah Imean .
*MOT: you Im sorry are you asking did I just point them out because .
*EXP: no no the ones you pointed out do you think its because shes seen them on tv or just because you recognized them .
*MOT: oh I just picked up youknow a toy that I saw oh this is from Clueless isnt it ?
*MOT: kinda looks like the dogs from Clueless .
*EXP: xxx how do you xxx .
*MOT: um Imean we have a PoohBear but its classic Pooh .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um so its different than this one and I just picked up the ones that I just saw and I wanted to pick up not because I thought she would like them in particular .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: well thats great thank you so much for helping us out and participating .
*MOT: youre welcome .
*EXP: you think I can ask you some questions ?
*MOT: sure .
*EXP: um what do you think Sofia liked to play with the most today ?
*MOT: uh I think the plastic stuff .
*MOT: food and the spoons and stuff .
*EXP: okay do you think um any of it was like really familiar to her ?
*MOT: unle not unless she remembers it from last time Imean we dont have any toy food like this .
*MOT: maybe the spoons yeah .
*MOT: yeah Imean she sees spoons all the time .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but um I think she just likes it mostly because its just hard plastic stuff that she can chew on .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: are any of these foods things that you think um at this point she might recognize the name of ?
*MOT: uh maybe Imean we have pizza for dinner every Fri I make pizza at home every Friday .
*MOT: and uh she eats peas all the time .
*MOT: and she eats bread all the time .
*MOT: and I dont know her father eats waffles um every once in awhile Im not sure if she recognizes that or not .
*MOT: and cheese she eats all the time .
*MOT: so um .
*MOT: yeah she might recognize those names .
*EXP: um how about something that she liked the least ?
*MOT: um I dont know Imean she wasnt super interested in the stuffed animals until I showed her the Pooh we have Pooh at home but ours is the classic Pooh version so he looks a little bit different but .
*MOT: we call him Pooh and she always smi I think she recognizes the name .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um got her bedroom is decorated with PoohBear so um shell point at the pictures and go whats that ?
*MOT: and uh we tell her thats Pooh and she always get a real big smile so um .
*EXP: aw .
*MOT: so I know she Im pretty sure she recognizes his name .
*MOT: um she didnt really Imean I didnt she mostly seemed interested in stuff that I like showed to her .
*MOT: except for some of this stuff she just grabbed .
*MOT: but um .
*MOT: and then the books um she kinda seemed to get a little bit bored .
*MOT: with them but at the beginning she was paying attention to them and enjoying it I think .
*MOT: usually when I try to read .
*MOT: I was surprised that she let me finish reading it .
*EXP: which book did you start with that she listened to more ?
*MOT: um this one PeekaBaby .
*EXP: oh okay .
*EXP: do you play uh peekaboo and pattycake and things like that at home ?
*MOT: yeah well when you say play pattycake do mean like say pattycake pattycake or do you just mean clapping ?
*EXP: uh I think youknow clap anything interactive .
*MOT: because we do clap together all the time she loves to clap .
*MOT: um and I guess we dont play peekaboo that often we play so big and um .
*MOT: clapping and wave byebye .
*EXP: heres a book .
*MOT: so Imean I she weve read um these Karen Katz books before though not this particular one but um .
*MOT: because she has alot of books with the f lift the flap thing .
*MOT: and so she might be useta that and we go to um story time at the library every week and the librarian reads those alot so .
*EXP: the pattycake refers to just like the action like so you have clapping in it and you have rolling in it and regardless if shes doing it youre playing it youknow ?
*MOT: uhuh .
*MOT: yeah Imean we dont do the full patty well we do that at story time actually but um regularly at home we dont do the whole pattycake game but Ill go like Sofia yay .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: yay .
*MOT: usually she claps back .
*MOT: yay can you clap for Mommy ?
*MOT: yay .
*MOT: yay .
*EXP: you do it on the spot and shes like I dont think so .
*EXP: I dont know what I did yet .
*MOT: yay .
*EXP: good job .
*MOT: and she also waves alot .
*MOT: its funny at story time um at the beginning we sing a hello song and everybody waves .
*MOT: and my two year old Emma Imean she just like talks and talks and talks and talks .
*MOT: sings and sings and sings and sings .
*MOT: and so anything that shes heard people say before she repeats it and every song that shes ever heard she repeats it so shell be like singing that hello song all the time .
*MOT: and as soon as Sofia hears her start singing it shell start waving .
*EXP: aw .
*EXP: well thats cute .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: shes like I know this .
*EXP: I know what Im sposta do .
*EXP: thats funny .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um is she drinking out of um bottles or sippycups ?
*MOT: both yeah she gets a bottle nighttime um .
*MOT: and uh she mostly nurses but she gets a bottle at nighttime and then um .
*MOT: she gets uh every once in awhile I get her I give her a sippycup just because Emma has one and she wants it but .
*MOT: she doesnt drink a whole lot from it but she does .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: drink a little bit .
*EXP: and usually it doesnt have juice in it .
*EXP: I heard you say .
*MOT: no shes never had juice .
*MOT: neither has Emma .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: oh actually Emma did have juice one time .
*MOT: but no they dont usually have juice we they usually have milk or water .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: I wish my Mom did that for me .
*EXP: now Im all about the sugar .
*MOT: its hard to Imean someday Im sure theyll like sugar alot no matter what I do but .
*MOT: but uh yeah for now they dont know what it tastes like so they dont ask for it .
*EXP: thats good .
*EXP: um was there .
*EXP: were there any differences to how she played youknow today like um the way that she played maybe with food or the animals or the books that was different from home ?
*MOT: the only real difference was that .
*MOT: hey look at you walking like a big girl can you take another step ?
*MOT: youre so big .
*MOT: whoopsie .
*MOT: she can take a few steps at a time now .
*MOT: um the only real difference was that she let me read the books .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: she usually grabs them away from me although the past few days she has been letting me read to her more .
*MOT: but mostly when I try to read to her she um she just grabs at the books .
*MOT: it probably helps that she was holding onto other toys .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: thats interesting .
*EXP: good to know youknow ?
*EXP: um does she is do you think shes familiar with any animal names ?
*MOT: s um maybe Imean we have a dog and um we call her puppy even though shes four .
*MOT: um just because shes little and crazy um .
*MOT: so shes probably atleast she familiar with that do youknow animal name um .
*MOT: and youknow sometimes when we read books .
*MOT: Imean we read lots of books with animals in them but I dont know much attention shes paying to that because shes either trying to grab the book away from me or shes distracted by something else and thats why shes not trying to grab the book away from me .
*MOT: um Im not sure she really pays attention that but atleast puppy she is probably familiar with .
*MOT: and maybe kitty because my parents have a cat and Emma calls it a kitty .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: um this book is just like is more like touch and feel so sometimes I think that that is interesting to her or xxx .
*MOT: uhuh .
*MOT: well the first one Imean I starte I read her this I think second and on the first page she wanted to feel that .
*MOT: but then she got bored of it and she didnt wanna look anymore .
*MOT: and she started playing with her toys .
*MOT: now you wanna play with it .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: but things like um farm animals are like horses cows .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: I dont Imean I doubt if she Imean shes heard us talk about them before and shes seen us read books but .
*MOT: oh thank you for the hug .
*MOT: um but like I said Imean I dont think she pays a whole lot of attention to the books so I dont know if shes like if you if I showed her a picture of a cow if she would remember like oh Ive seen that before .
*MOT: youknow I dont know .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: youknow I dont know its hard to tell .
