*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: just a few questions for you .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: so during this session which toys um do you think Alexander was most interested in ?
*MOT: its hard to say because I switched it up on him a lot .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: because I kept showing him new things .
*MOT: but he like the uh measuring spoons a lot .
*MOT: cause has the keys .
*MOT: and then I think he likes when he gets something if you try to take it .
*MOT: he liked it so .
*MOT: um he was first drawn to the stuffed animals I think .
*MOT: but that might have been because he was facing them .
*MOT: but then he liked he didnt like the books that much .
*MOT: hey .
*EXP: and why do you think he liked okay well you said he probably liked the stuffed toy animals because they were in front of him .
*EXP: why do you think he likes the play food .
*MOT: um I think we dont have any play food at home so maybe that was it .
*MOT: plus if he bangs it can make a sound .
*MOT: he likes to do stuff like that .
*MOT: um and it feels feels different and everything .
*MOT: um if anything he probably liked the stuffed animals because they have a face and he loves just interacting .
*MOT: thats his biggest his biggest thing .
*EXP: do you think there have been any items that um his interests maybe have changed since the last time that like before he was here from the last time he was here .
*MOT: the last time ?
*EXP: do you think any of his interests have changed ?
*MOT: um he was definitely more interested uh in the items themselves than he was last time .
*MOT: like I probably could have just sat here and watched him and he would have played the whole time .
*MOT: I wouldnt have ev even hadta do anything with him .
*MOT: versus in the past .
*MOT: it was a lit so I think he liked the food items more than he did last time .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: what have you got ?
*EXP: so which book um wo do you think that Alexander would prefer to read or look at with you ?
*MOT: um probably the pat the the touch and feel book .
*MOT: he likes stuff like that he likes things with animals .
*MOT: um of the books that were there the only one we have is good night moon .
*MOT: we dont ha uh we might have one of the other ones .
*MOT: but the ones that he usually reads arent arent in that pile .
*MOT: um but he likes to touch and eat stuff so .
*MOT: I would say the texture book was his he would like better .
*EXP: um does Alexander play with any similar toys at home ?
*MOT: um he has some stuffed animals .
*MOT: he doesnt have any food items .
*MOT: um so not that many similar .
*MOT: a lot of them are very different actually .
*MOT: he has a toy box in our basement .
*MOT: and he goes in just like he did here and he pulls himself up and he pulls stuff out .
*MOT: but its theres like to tools and theres a lot of puzzles .
*MOT: the puzzles where you pull it away and the same piece is there .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: the pictures underneath it but he likes that a lot .
*MOT: um uh he likes he likes things that have music .
*MOT: so we have a lot of things like that .
*MOT: so most of the things here we do not have at home .
*EXP: do you think Alexander prefers books or toys ?
*MOT: toys .
*EXP: does Alexander play with any dolls at home ?
*MOT: um theres some teddy bears that hell play with sometimes .
*MOT: but not much .
*MOT: he has them there but he doesnt really play with them .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: do you think that he recognized any of the foods ?
*EXP: from the last time he was here ?
*EXP: or even maybe he can recognize any of them from home ?
*MOT: um not from home .
*MOT: uh from last time .
*MOT: we played with the peas a lot last time he was playing wi .
*MOT: I dunno .
*MOT: I cant tell if he recognized them or not .
*EXP: and at this point do you think that Alexander recognizes the names of any of these items ?
*EXP: or is he beginning to recognize the name of some of these toys ?
*MOT: hes beginning to recognize the names of um some animals .
*MOT: and I think baby sometimes he recognizes .
*MOT: uh the foods no .
*MOT: because I dont use those terms a lot .
*EXP: what animals has he started to recognize ?
*MOT: um lion .
*MOT: we have a lion at home that he plays with a lot .
*MOT: and uh dog .
*MOT: he seems to slowly be starting to recognize .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and are there any other items that arent here um maybe that theyre at home or somewhere else that you think that maybe Alexanders recognized the names of ?
*MOT: um lets think .
*MOT: I think diaper .
*MOT: he recognizes the name of .
*MOT: um not a whole lot yet though .
*MOT: not a whole lot yet .
*MOT: and I dont know if thats because I dont use the words a lot .
*MOT: or hes just not ready for it .
*MOT: definitely he recognizes the name of mom and dad .
*MOT: things like that .
*MOT: but as far as toys go not not as much .
*MOT: thats it .
*MOT: sure .
