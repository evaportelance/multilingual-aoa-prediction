*MOT: okay go see Didi .
*MOT: well I always whenever we play its the same thing we just pull the toys out and she uh goes for what she feels like playing with for the day .
*MOT: she always likes playing with toys geared towards babies .
*MOT: um but there werent really any baby these are like older I think she associated because its small with the babies so um .
*MOT: but she likes playing with real pretend .
*MOT: pretend real stuff I should say .
*MOT: if that makes sense like uh cooking toys or cell phones her purse .
*MOT: she likes to play dressup .
*MOT: and alot of that is dictated to by Micah her sister because she likes to play dressup so they play together .
*MOT: when Micahs at school and its just Quinn and I then well youknow well play with um she has the the stacking blocks that um have letters on them so .
*MOT: she doesnt really stack them moreso that she uses them as projectiles and um .
*MOT: um just to have them around she doesnt really play with the blocks I pull them out all the time legos .
*MOT: she likes to stack legos .
*MOT: she likes to put them together .
*MOT: and take them apart youknow .
*MOT: um nothing to build anything constructive that you can say oh look at the car .
*MOT: its not like that she just likes to connect them and take them apart .
*MOT: she likes playing with her little she has a little laptop at home that she likes .
*MOT: it makes noise its its age appropriate for her .
*MOT: talks about the colors and then she always goes back to this one particular color xxx because it has this one particular song that she likes and she knows how to I cant get to the song but she knows how to get .
*MOT: and its consistent so um .
*MOT: but uh we have little animal toys .
*MOT: its not very really fond of them so I put them and I kept trying to get her to even look at the animal toys here and shes not into that .
*MOT: and then I guess that are they into things at this age they have what they like they have their preferences .
*MOT: but she does like cooking stuff even at home um .
*MOT: her aunt lives with us too um .
*MOT: Jeremys sister um .
*MOT: so uh she will say ooh Quinny whatcha cooking ?
*MOT: pretends like shes whipping up this feast and .
*MOT: like we pick up the pen and say mm bite mm bite youknow she wants to so she has an imagination .
*MOT: we dont see what shes imagining but youknow you can guess .
*MOT: based on uh but yeah I um .
*MOT: Mich Im just thinking because Micah did this same study not the the longitudinal part but the play .
*MOT: Michah always would go towards the food .
*MOT: same as Quinny youknow its uh its funny to me and Micah never really played with the animal toys now theyre just so girly .
*MOT: theyre so girly girl youknow .
*EXP: they had purses .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: and Quinn wont leave the house that is shes like the purse mm purse youknow she hasta have it .
*MOT: so um toys like this dont really spark her interest .
*MOT: babies bottles her diapers she goes and gets hers .
*MOT: the ottoman where we keep them do the hideaway stuff the the diapers she goes and gets her diapers and puts her diapers on her babies .
*MOT: so um but but these toys dont dont lend to youknow um so maybe thats why she was stuck towards the cooking .
*EXP: you mean because these ones are like a little older ?
*MOT: yeah well .
*MOT: I know like these we we have model toys at home as well .
*MOT: she ne she very rarely plays with them if she does its only because Micah had it and then shell want it but then she loses interest drop it and the minute Micah picks it up again shell go and get it .
*MOT: that kind of thing .
*MOT: but these are not what she likes to play with she loves to play with dolls .
*MOT: and uh with babies .
*EXP: so these look like .
*MOT: yeah I think these look like older kids but she didnt because normally shell be oh baby .
*MOT: and you saw that even the little baby that she kept she kept focusing on the baby .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: thats what she does thats what she loves to do .
*MOT: um and coloring .
*MOT: and Ive been trying to get her to draw st thats not happening .
*MOT: Quinn is uh we call her baby G baby gangster because she just does what she wants to do when she wants to do it and she doesnt care .
*MOT: but uh we say no .
*MOT: shes vocal about telling you .
*MOT: and with an attitude .
*MOT: where are you getting that from ?
*MOT: you know ?
*EXP: well its pretty good about doing stuff she was getting bored I think xxx .
*MOT: shes very good .
*MOT: and shes ver shes an excellent helper like I you saw how she was organizing the stuff .
*MOT: shes the one who cleans up .
*MOT: Micah .
*MOT: we tell her Micah clean up clean up Micah wont clean up but Quinn .
*MOT: and then like even when I go put my shoes on shell go and get my shoes and say here Mommy and she com she wants to help me .
*MOT: because shes a helper Quinnys a helper .
*MOT: um and a nurturer I think .
*MOT: and a bully all at the same time .
*MOT: youknow ?
*EXP: yeah she kinda xxx .
*MOT: yes yes .
*MOT: and then uh she knows when shes cutting up and shell give you that look and you youll see when you play back like the eyes and .
*MOT: but yeah shes shes an imaginative little girl um .
*MOT: and and neither one of them like well have the television on for background noise and we dont watch anything other than and at the time it was called Noggin but now its NickJunior with Moose and Zee .
*MOT: those are youknow itll be playing in the background its like preschool on television .
*MOT: so we dont watch like Spongebob things stupid shows like that we dont do that um .
*MOT: if its on its on Nog uh NickJunior where she can .
*MOT: or on Disney which has LittleEinsteins which is the exposure to the arts and classical music and dance .
*MOT: so she loves that they both um are big dancers .
*MOT: Imean and with rhythm and purpose .
*MOT: Quinn .
*MOT: and uh so shell be in this in uh car and I listen to W T O P mainly for traffic and weather but just because youknow I dont like them mainstream music that has all the sex innuendos and things like that I dont want them exposed to that right now .
*MOT: um and um but if it if she catches a a small beat of like BrunoMars she loses her mind .
*MOT: that is her man she loves BrunoMars and I didnt understand that .
*MOT: but its like and uh and no other artist gets that reaction out of her so she loves to dance and then um .
*MOT: this is her dance kinda move .
*MOT: this her move .
*MOT: you cant tell her shes not jamming youknow ?
*MOT: so .
*MOT: she loves dance she loves music .
*MOT: neither one of them are really up on the television unless its their shows that they like .
*MOT: um Backyardigans which is dance based .
*MOT: alotof good music and then theres a new one called Bubbleguppies thats really has like funky kinda music that she really likes .
*MOT: toys .
*MOT: she would much rather come and sit on a lap and stick her hand right here and suck her thumb .
*MOT: shes just .
*MOT: I try to get her engaged in things and so we go to the library .
*MOT: and they have youknow storytime and then like puppets and playtime and shell shell engage with that .
*MOT: um the ChuckyCheese uh big ChuckyCheese uh people that are in the the suit .
*MOT: youknow in the the actual ChuckyCheese she likes she goes up and she hugs them .
*MOT: and most kids her age are really leery of that but shes not .
*EXP: so shes not too shy or .
*MOT: shes shy but with anima with animated um I guess uh avatar type animals um .
*MOT: like the Disney uh Goofy .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: like the xxx youknow people that she doesnt I think she knows her people Im or maybe she doesnt .

*MOT: and then hi to the same person .
*MOT: hi and Im like just ignore her you dont hafta say hi anymore shes just gonna keep saying hi so shes very friendly .
*MOT: but shes leery like in one on one situations people that she doesnt know .
*MOT: I hope Im answering your questions .
*EXP: yeah no .
*EXP: um is there anything else like about the way today was it um any much different than in the other sessions like I think you said she .
*MOT: just that these toys are different see the prior to todays session each time we came it was the same toys .
*EXP: mm .

*EXP: because yeah these are more a little older so xxx they can do a little more .
*MOT: right these are older toys .
*EXP: more with it .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: but shes not going to now she likes real tools which is why I thought she would youknow flock to this but she was more impor more looking at taking it apart as opposed to the actual mechanics of screwing the thing in and .
*MOT: but at home .
*MOT: youknow because uh we were doing projects putting up ceiling fans and she just kept flocking to the to the screwdriver .
*MOT: of couse thats dangerous you dont wanna but she was like I youknow yeah dat mine it mine youknow .
*MOT: um possessive of her things she does say me and my .
*MOT: and like I was telling you I understand her .
*MOT: what shes saying and Micah even understands her better than all of us .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but I guess they speak that language but um .
*MOT: her toy preference here you if you noticed she just kept going to the food and to the domestic type and thats why Im like .
*MOT: dont get too comfortable .
*MOT: dont get too comfortable .
*EXP: does she try to help you in the kitchen too when you cook maybe she likes .
*MOT: yeah .
