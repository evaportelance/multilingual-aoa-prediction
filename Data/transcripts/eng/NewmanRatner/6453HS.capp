*MOT: um the playing with the food and cooking pretending to cook .
*MOT: um and she does she doesnt dress the babydolls at home as much .
*EXP: oh really ?
*MOT: but we dont have as many clothes but she likes to like at home she likes to put them to sleep cover them with blankets .
*MOT: and um she has one that sits on the potty and everything so .
*MOT: she does that .
*MOT: she doesnt do as much of the dressing so .
*MOT: that was new for her .
*EXP: so today she was helping you like put the boots on and stuff .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: should we move you guys over a little bit ?
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um so you said at home she mostly will put them to sleep and stuff so today that was like a brand new thing ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: oh thats cool .
*MOT: yep .
*EXP: and then you said you have toy food at home ?
*MOT: yeah she has the toy food and she has like the little sink or yeah the stove and refrigerator with a bunch of play food so .
*MOT: she enjoys that .
*MOT: she just got it for her birthday so .
*EXP: oh so just the other day .
*MOT: its new too .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: does she do the same kind of things like putting in the pan and stuff ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yeah and then she tries to share it with everybody so .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: do you think she recognizes some of these foods ?
*MOT: I think so .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: Imean some of them were are unfamiliar .
*MOT: but but I know she recognized the peas and the corn .
*MOT: a lot of the vegetables are common to her but she probably doesnt recognize some of these other things .
*MOT: she definitely recognized the icecream .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: do you think she um the ones that you showed her like has she ever seen you eat any of them maybe like some of the ones like the kind of different kinds of foods ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yeah like the sushi shes never had herself .
*MOT: but shes seen us eat it .
*MOT: and then shes never seen a kiwi I dont think .
*MOT: but yeah Imean I think most of them are familiar to her .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: does she try to ever help you in the kitchen like stirring stuff and ?
*MOT: oh yes .
*MOT: yes she does .
*MOT: yeah she um sometimes too much .
*EXP: yeah thats fine .
*EXP: what were you saying sometimes what ?
*MOT: sometimes she helps a lot .
*MOT: like Imean things like baking cookies she shes really helpful with .
*MOT: but when its something hot no .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: Im a little nervous to have her help .
*EXP: you wanna go see the fountain ?
*EXP: well save the barn for you right here .
*EXP: okay ?
*EXP: you come back .
*EXP: um so she likes to help you like try to mix up stuff ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: so she shes pretty helpful with anything I let her try so .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: yeah she seemed to know what the stove was and know that .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: I dont think did she try to cook on it at all though ?
*MOT: uh she turned the dials but I think that was her pretending too .
*EXP: and then with the animals did you you tried to get her to play with it but ?
*MOT: yeah I called her attention to it but she didnt really seem that interested .
*MOT: um at home she plays with dinosaurs like this .
*MOT: and she loves that .
*MOT: so shes really into dinosaurs .
*MOT: but um I guess shes never seen this size of all those animals .
*MOT: Im not sure why she wasnt interested in those but .
*EXP: maybe just the foods were exciting for now .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: food and the dolls so .
*EXP: well and these are all new so .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: from the other visits .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: did she do kind of similar things to um what she did in the other visits ?
*MOT: uh no it seemed like everythings changed developmentally like .
*MOT: Imean before she would just like pick up the food and like try to put them in her mouth and now shes pretending to cook them and um .
*MOT: and she wasnt even interested in the dolls last time .
*MOT: she didnt really care about them .
*MOT: and now clearly she does .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: yeah she probably would have gone straight for just the food last time .
*MOT: and maybe the animals but not actually like playing with them .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: now I imagine she would have like lined them up and like played with them and pretend theyre eating things and things like that so .
*MOT: thats what she does at home .
*EXP: so at home you said she doesnt have those .
*MOT: with it .
*MOT: she doesnt have those .
*MOT: she like lines up her dinosaurs and then pretends theyre eating from the trees and things like that .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: I think the other visits it was like stuffed animals .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: like more baby xxx .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: do you think she would recognize um any of these animals ?
*EXP: like have you ever been to the aquarium or like ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: she probably would .
*MOT: Imean maybe not these but like definitely the zebra and the panda .
*MOT: and definitely the pig .
*MOT: if theres a tiger in here somewhere shed recogni .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: so probably about half of them shed recognize .
*EXP: have you guys been to the zoo or something ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yeah and we read a lot of animals .
*MOT: animal books .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: she likes to read a lot with you ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: oh yeah thats like one of her favorite things to do .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: I dont know if she was interested in this book I dont know .
*MOT: she has it at home .
*MOT: so maybe it was just she had seen it already so .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: well and theres I think at the other visits there was more there were more books and today theres just this one .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: do you guys does she um do you guys read like every day ?
*MOT: oh yes .
*MOT: thats we spend a lot o we probably read for about a at least an hour a day .
*MOT: she loves it so much .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: so um .
*MOT: and actually shell her favorite books that she likes to hear all the time over and over again shes actually memorized a lot of the words .
*MOT: so yes .
*MOT: she she enjoys reading a lot .
*EXP: thats good .
*EXP: um is there anything else that was different about the session that you wanna tell me ?
*EXP: I know you said that the dressing was something new .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: the way she played with the the food was totally different then .
*MOT: Imean I dont know if they had the food .
*MOT: I think there was food earlier .
*MOT: but she didnt play with it the same way .
*MOT: um and I guess her attention span was a little bit longer in this one for the toys .
*MOT: like she probably wouldnt have played with any one toy as long as she did in the last visits .
*MOT: she probably would have just moved from toy to toy .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: I thought she was gonna jump to the animals because she seemed like she was getting tired of the food kinda but then she went right back for it .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: I guess with the doll she sort of incorporated them .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: shes does that at home she feeds everything .
*MOT: she even tries to feed the dog .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: thats cute .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: yeah it seemed like she was real pretty familiar with that stuff .
*EXP: I just yeah I wonder if she would have known because the thing that is cool about these too is we have the scenes and this has little scenes in it so we try to switch them up .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: I think sometimes theyre too young to know kinda like what goes where .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yep .
*MOT: yeah she yeah Im not sure why she wasnt interested .
*MOT: but theres a lot out so .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: and then does she have anything like this at home ?
*MOT: not like that .
*MOT: no she has like a little fake hammer but nothing fine motor like this .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: Imean tool wise .
*MOT: but she has other fine motor toys but um theyre like the little stackable youknow like the little posts with the stackable rings .
*MOT: that kind of thing .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: she doesnt really have anything like that either .
*MOT: I guess all of this is kinda new .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: its a lot at one time .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um she seemed to be familiar kinda like what the screw or she figured it out when I was doing it with her earlier kinda how to do it .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: so I didnt know if she had something like that at home .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: uhuh .
*EXP: but .
*MOT: no that was new too .
*EXP: you said she likes to stack blocks and stuff ?
*MOT: oh yeah .
*MOT: yeah we have legos and then we have .
*MOT: she stacks .
*MOT: we dont really have just blocks .
*MOT: but she stacks other things .
*MOT: like sometimes rather impressively .
*EXP: yeah I think like well she was helping me with the blocks but I think she was getting mad doing it on her own .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: but I was trying to see if she could do youknow one .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: Im sure she probably could have I think she was getting frustrated .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: she doesnt normally work with just the square blocks .
*MOT: I know what it is .
*MOT: we have all these different shaped blocks .
*MOT: so she they have triangles and ar youknow like little arches and things .
*MOT: and she plays with that for a long time .
*MOT: and she stacks those and those arent even uniform shape so .
*EXP: hm .
*EXP: maybe that was kind of it was just like something weird .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: big big chair now .
*MOT: scoop .
*EXP: yeah shes really talking a lot .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: you said just like in the last week she learned a lot more words ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: Imean its sort of like a language explosion for the last month and a half .
*MOT: Imean I was a little concerned for a little while until she was like twenty months and then all the sudden it was like .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: explosion of words so .
*MOT: Imean shell put like four words together in a phrase that actually makes sense pretty regularly which I dunno if thats .
*EXP: thats good .
*EXP: thats yeah .
*EXP: usually around two theyre doing like two um two words together maybe three .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: thats good .
*EXP: yeah I heard her saying kinda long sentences like she said grandmas glasses and stuff like that .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: so shes doing a lot of that .
*EXP: thats good yeah .
*EXP: really talkative .
*EXP: um okay so I guess the last thing I can try to do the last two things and see .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: see if shell go for it .
*EXP: and then thatll be it .
*MOT: alright .
*EXP: so thank you so much .
*MOT: yeah .
