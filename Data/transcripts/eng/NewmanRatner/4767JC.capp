*CHI: wings .
*MOT: wings they have wings ?
*MOT: yep .
*MOT: theyre birds with wings .
*EXP: seemed to interest him the most ?
*EXP: do you think ?
*MOT: I think he was a fan of the peas .
*MOT: and the keys .
*MOT: haha the peas and the keys .
*EXP: and why do you think .
*MOT: and actually the the plush toys too .
*MOT: Im surprised that he wasnt interested in the books .
*MOT: because at home he loves his books .
*EXP: really ?
*EXP: oh why .
*MOT: but he has he has specific .
*MOT: Im sorry what were you gonna ask ?
*EXP: no I was just gonna ask like why do you think he was more like interested in those .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: I mean clearly the keys hes interested in because he can chew on them .
*MOT: and hes teething .
*MOT: so anything he can chew on right now .
*MOT: and they make noise .
*MOT: when he shakes them .
*MOT: not really sure about the peas .
*MOT: thats my guess .
*MOT: and he also was going after the plush things more than he does at home .
*MOT: because he has lots of stuffed animals that he generally ignores and goes more for the books at home .
*MOT: so who knows .
*EXP: do you think probably because these stuffed animals are like new to him maybe ?
*MOT: they might be .
*MOT: and I think I know with his books at home he xxx he definitely has favorites .
*MOT: and those are the ones that he always that we read over and over .
*MOT: because the none of these were .
*MOT: I actually thought hed love this one because we have where is babys belly button .
*MOT: but maybe since these were different they werent he wasnt as drawn to them ?
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: but these being different were apparently interesting to him so .
*EXP: out of all the stuffed animals which one do you think he had most interest with ?
*MOT: um what was the first one ?
*MOT: that chicken .
*MOT: where is it ?
*MOT: here yeah .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: haha is this a funny chicken ?
*MOT: dont gag yourself mister .
*EXP: so out of all the toys which one would you say he liked the least ?
*MOT: oh the least ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: all the toys that are here ?
*MOT: or all the toys that he played with ?
*EXP: all the toys that are here ?
*MOT: because I mean some of them he didnt even look at .
*MOT: he was re he seemed really indifferent to the baby doll .
*EXP: haha .
*MOT: what did you like the least Jack ?
*EXP: do you feel like he played with a lot of the foods ?
*MOT: I was gonna say the food stuff he wasnt that interested in .
*MOT: I mean with the exception of the peas .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: the food probably the food stuff in general he was least interested in .
*EXP: do you think if you said any of the names of the items would he recognize them ?
*MOT: not at this point .
*MOT: I dont think so no .
*MOT: I mean .
*EXP: if you said like peas would he know thats peas ?
*MOT: hm .
*EXP: cookies is cookies ?
*MOT: hm .
*MOT: the only thing he would probably know is if there was .
*MOT: well I actually just noticed this .
*MOT: like he might recognize this because he does he has a cup .
*MOT: that he drinks water from .
*MOT: but I I I would be .
*MOT: no I dont think he would recognize the names of the other foods .
*EXP: okay and do you have any toys like this at home other than like just the stuffed animals and books ?
*MOT: um stuffed animals and books .
*MOT: we dont have any of this kind of food stuff no .
*EXP: okay and you were reading that book to him .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: wh do you see if there were any items that really interest him in that one ?
*MOT: in this one ?
*MOT: I mean its the flaps .
*EXP: the flaps ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: like which flaps did he like ?
*MOT: um I think he liked the ones that were .
*MOT: like he liked the umbrella .
*MOT: and he liked the he had trouble with um the curtains .
*MOT: he liked this one the ball .
*MOT: hes a big fan of balls .
*MOT: thats why I was trying to make this into a ball type object .
*MOT: because he seems to really .
*MOT: be a fan of balls lately .
*MOT: yeah I would say the ball in here and the umbrella .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: were the two that he were the two flaps he liked .
*EXP: okay would you overall say that hes interested in books or toys ?
*MOT: Id say that he has a runny nose .
*MOT: here or at home ?
*EXP: here .
*MOT: here .
*MOT: toys .
*EXP: toys .
*EXP: and at home you would say books ?
*MOT: well .
*EXP: its hard to tell ?
*MOT: I would say its probably much more equal at home .
*EXP: okay okay .
*EXP: and have you ever played pretend food at home ?
*MOT: we havent .
*EXP: you havent ?
*MOT: you like to watch mommy and daddy cook .
*MOT: with real food .
*MOT: and we explain real food to you .
*MOT: but we dont have plastic food .
*EXP: so do you think hell recognize any of the foods at home ?
*MOT: um outside of dog food ?
*MOT: haha .
*MOT: probably not yet at this point .
*MOT: I mean he he watches us .
*MOT: and hes very interested in what were doing .
*MOT: but I dont know that theres recognition yet between youknow .
*MOT: milk .
*MOT: and flour .
*MOT: and chicken and that kind of stuff .
*EXP: okay and Im assuming he probably doesnt play with any dolls at home ?
*MOT: um well Im not gender Imean we dont we dont have any just because hes the first .
*MOT: um but I will say that we were at friends house a few weeks ago .
*MOT: and she has a son and a daughter .
*MOT: and they got lots of trucks and lots of dolls .
*MOT: and we dont have either .
*MOT: we dont t we dont have trucks for him yet or dolls .
*MOT: and he was very interested in the trucks so .
*MOT: haha .
*EXP: okay well thats good .
*MOT: we have st lots of stuffed animals .
*MOT: but we dont have baby dolls yet do we ?
*MOT: no we dont .
*EXP: okay and that is it .
*MOT: you love these .
*MOT: you love these keys .
*MOT: reach them ?
*EXP: so I just have a couple questions for you .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: okay so are were there any toys that he seemed interested last time but this time xxx .
*MOT: last time he was really interested in the stuffed animals .
*MOT: um which I thought was odd because he doesnt really play with stuffed animals at home .
*MOT: but this time he completely ignored them .
*EXP: what did he seem the most interested in this time ?
*MOT: this time I was really surprised that he went for this first .
*MOT: because last time he didnt really care about it .
*EXP: you dont have any dolls at home ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: um and last time the thing he was most interested in were the food things .
*MOT: like the peas I remember he really liked .
*MOT: and I think some of that Im not sure he knows its food .
*MOT: I think its nice to chew on .
*MOT: everything goes in his mouth .
*MOT: and he also really liked the keys last time .
*MOT: um which we didnt actually have before our visit .
*MOT: um but after the visit we ended up going and buying him some keys .
*MOT: and um he usually loves books .
*MOT: and he just I think its because theres all these new toys he s just doesnt care about the books .
*MOT: but at home hes we read a lot .
*EXP: so you dont think he recognizes the names of any of these ?
*MOT: I dont think so no .
*MOT: not yet .
*MOT: Imean he eats peas .
*MOT: but Im not sure that he knows what they look like because he usually eats them mashed up .
*MOT: hes just kinda started to eat them as finger food .
*MOT: the spaghetti ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: which Imean he has pasta .
*MOT: hes never had spaghetti .
*MOT: so I dont I really dont think he knows that thats spaghetti .
*MOT: I think he just likes to chew on it .
*MOT: no I was wondering that .
*MOT: but I dont think he can .
*EXP: okay oh you want my pen ?
*MOT: the other thing I thought was really interesting .
*MOT: and I dont know if this this couldve been just me trying to do it more .
*MOT: but it looked like he was trying to put the food onto the plate .
*MOT: which surprised me because he doesnt .
*MOT: hes still too young .
*MOT: we dont give him Imean if we cut up food that he uses as finger food we just put it on his tray of his highchair .
*MOT: he doesnt Imean if I gave him a plate hed chuck it onto the floor .
*MOT: but that coulda just been me wishing .
*EXP: okay and the animals do you think he recognizes any of the animals names ?
*EXP: or the books ?
*MOT: I dont think so yet .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: do you have any of these toys at home ?
*MOT: um the k weve got keys .
*MOT: weve obviously got books .
*MOT: and um we have stuffed animals .
*MOT: but none of these specific ones .
*MOT: but we dont have any food toys yet .
*MOT: hah look what I just spotted .
*MOT: theres a ball here that I didnt even notice .
*MOT: balls are usually his favorite .
*MOT: Jack look at what we missed .
