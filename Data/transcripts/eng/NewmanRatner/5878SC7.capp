*EXP: is it okay if I ask you some questions now ?
*MOT: sure .
*EXP: what do you think he liked to play with the most what was his favorite ?
*MOT: this little cookie .
*EXP: how did he play with it ?
*MOT: I think its like its kindof novel as far as a toy that he can fit in his hand really easily .
*MOT: so he was .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: feeling it banging it .
*MOT: sticking it in his mouth .
*MOT: and he set it down and hed play something else and hed come right back to it .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: was there anything else do you think he knows is familiar with either the like the name of it or the shape or the color what do you think was most attractive ?
*MOT: it might be that its colorful or .
*MOT: Im trying to think I cant even think of a single toy that we have that looks like this .
*MOT: at our house .
*MOT: so it might be the fact that its novel .
*MOT: but like I tried to show him the peas which are about the same size I thought theyd be equally interesting and theyre not .
*MOT: theyre just not so I think its a combination of color and .
*MOT: maybe size ?
*MOT: once he got it in his hand like this .
*MOT: just like .
*MOT: what was that ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: you just love it .
*MOT: Im kindof baffled .
*MOT: I think too I dont know it might be recognizeably recognizeable as food .
*MOT: something that looks like food .
*EXP: was he putting it in his mouth ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: yeah ?
*MOT: yup .
*MOT: and hes just starting to get to finger foods now like where he wants to put his own food in his mouth .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: even though hes not very successful .
*EXP: hes trying .
*MOT: hes trying .
*EXP: were there any other toys that he liked playing with ?
*MOT: he liked he likes books in general he liked this one better than he liked he wanted to read this one .
*MOT: he was navigating his own way through this one .
*MOT: turning the pages and feeling all the things and then you turn the page and feel the things so .
*MOT: he really liked that one .
*MOT: he liked the keys .
*MOT: they make a shaky noise huh ?
*MOT: and he played with this one for a significant amount of time .
*MOT: and the spoon .
*MOT: thats pretty typical we have alot of like long handle spoons and stuff that I let him play with he really likes those in general .
*MOT: I tried a couple stuffed animals and he was not interested .
*EXP: do you have um keys for him to play with at home or .
*MOT: yeah nothing quite that small or easily to manage I think his stuff is a little more bulky to manage so I think .
*MOT: this is a little attractive .
*MOT: because its a little bit easier to wield .
*EXP: you think the noise was attractive ?
*MOT: I think so .
*MOT: but he seemed as interested just to look at them as to shake them I dont know he shook them more than he shook other things though .
*MOT: I think probably the noise was important .
*EXP: did um he did did you try to play with the babydoll or did you try to introduce that ?
*MOT: I didnt introduce the babydoll weve looked at babydolls at our house before and he hasnt been that interested .
*EXP: mkay .
*MOT: not yet .
*EXP: what do you think was the least favorite thing ?
*MOT: not yet .
*EXP: in here .
*MOT: well .
*MOT: I dont know like I said I tried to use the stuffed animals and hes just not interested .
*MOT: I dont know if its .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: so we try to use them at home too and its just not interesting too .
*MOT: stuffed animals are just not interesting .
*EXP: were the animal names in OnTheFarm book do you think that any of them were familiar to him ?
*MOT: yeah I think so I think the .
*MOT: well Im not sure if the animal names he knows the s well I think he recognizes the sounds a little more like if I moo .
*MOT: or if I baa like a sheep .
*MOT: or like the horse whinny he really loves the horse whinny it makes him giggle .
*MOT: everytime .
*MOT: so I think maybe he recognizes some of th I think he recognizes some of the animal sounds .
*MOT: particularly the cow the sheep and the horse .
*EXP: the sound effects that you bring with it ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um and then I noticed you call what are do you always call him Scott or Scottie what are some .
*MOT: its usually Scott or Scottie his Dad sometimes calls him pants .
*MOT: I have no idea why .
*MOT: Scott or Scottie though most of the time .
*MOT: his brother usually calls him Scottie .
*EXP: are you using any um baby signs ?
*MOT: just a little bit like more and book are pretty much the extent of baby signs at this point .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um how is it different than uh playing at home ?
*EXP: do you .
*EXP: um despite I think he has a sibling so also playing together ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: sometimes .
*MOT: um his brothers at the age where he appreciates social interaction um positive social interaction so .
*MOT: when he feels like his brothers entertained by him hes really happy about that so he does try to entertain Scott alot .
*MOT: and sing songs then plays with his toes and things like that .
*MOT: and he occasionally tries to read him books like he has some memorized that hell try to read to him .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: which is really fun .
*MOT: and he loves it he just eats it up .
*MOT: he adores his brother of course .
*MOT: as all younger siblings do right ?
*MOT: and usually he wants whatever his older brother has and thats off limits .
*MOT: its always youknow the older brothers like no Im not gonna share with you .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: um do you I think you played also with the clock do you think as far as a time do you have a clock at home ?
*MOT: I have a big one on the wall .
*MOT: but the numbers are different .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: like ours we have like roman numeral numbers or whatever so .
*MOT: Im not sure if hes familiar with it at all .
*MOT: pretty high up on the wall too like I was thinking about it I dont I just dont even know if its in his range of vision most of the time hes like on the floor or on the couch and thats still like another three or four feet above him so .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: so do you do like uh counting with him ?
*MOT: we do by default because were working on it with his brother .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: alot .
*EXP: so he does hear those .
*MOT: he hears those words those numbers alot .
*MOT: hi .
*MOT: what can I do for you youre so busy playing .
*MOT: what can I do for you ?
*MOT: what can I do for you ?
*EXP: do you ever play um like pattycake or any other types of like touchy kind of games like sensor .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: we do pattycake we do .
*MOT: called one called ball for baby .
*MOT: and usually what I do is I do like the little signs while Im singing it and then I hold his hands and let him do them and he thinks thats very funny .
*MOT: and we have a mirror .
*MOT: like I pulled a mirror out of our bedroom .
*MOT: and I will sit with him on my lap and well look in and Ill let him do the hand signs and he enjoys that too like he thinks its very cool to watch the baby do it .
*MOT: hm .
*EXP: thats really cute .
*EXP: and then like stuff uh tick like tickling games and things like that .
*MOT: mhm .

*MOT: psst psst .
*MOT: psst psst psst psst psst xxx get you .
*EXP: he already knows whats coming .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yep .
*EXP: um do you think he knows any of these foods I know we kindof strayed away from there but any of them being familiar or looking familiar or .
*MOT: thats a good question sorry Ill try not to cough in the microphone um .
*MOT: I dont know actually .
*MOT: like he is as yet hes not really started finger foods yet .
*MOT: most of his stuff is puree .
*MOT: and so what he sees or I think like the only thing like he probably recognizes is the banana .
*MOT: because thats the only thing he gets more up close .
*MOT: trying to think .
*MOT: like he might recognize bread because we do alot of sandwiches at lunch time with his brother but .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: hes a little bit lower Im like trying to think hes like a little bit his high chairs a little bit lower than .
*MOT: the table so his eye levels like right at the table level like maybe two inches above it would be hard for him to really see the food so I dont think so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: its uh youknow .
*EXP: hes young .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: sometimes when theres another sibling they hear alot of youknow like pizza or whatever the sibling is .
*MOT: into yeah .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: exactly .
*EXP: um and then are you doing like body parts with him or .
*MOT: sometimes we do mostly were doing the ones that hes excited about so were working right now with toes and feet and fingers and hands .
*MOT: and thats about it .
*MOT: I think we do eyes .
*MOT: weve been doing eyes too .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: so do you just a final question is there anything that you think was like very different in how he played with you today ?
*EXP: um than usual .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: no I think this is pretty typical .
*MOT: he selfmotivates alot of his play .
*MOT: he likes for me to play with him but especially if a toy is new hell play by himself for a long time like without .
*MOT: yeah it is really nice .
*MOT: both of my boys are like that .
*MOT: a long attention span xxx .
*MOT: yeah ?
*EXP: he is really practicing .
