*MOT: okay .
*EXP: um and I can explain them a little bit .
*EXP: since were at the end of the longitudinal study .
*MOT: uhhuh .
*EXP: let me get you .
*EXP: a clipboard .
*EXP: did you get a chance to finish filling these out ?
*MOT: I did .
*EXP: you did ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: good job with that .
*MOT: good luck .
*MOT: there it goes .
*MOT: does that fit her ?
*EXP: okay so .
*MOT: wed hafta try a different outfit Samantha .
*EXP: crazy .
*MOT: here why dont you try these ?
*EXP: oh got it .
*MOT: oh .
*EXP: um okay so there are two consent forms .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: now the first one is the final one .
*EXP: and then we have an additional one on top of that .
*EXP: um so final .
*EXP: since were at the end of the longitudinal study .
*EXP: um this just explains a little bit more what we were looking at .
*EXP: so it explains that weve recorded Samanthas speech .
*EXP: samples from seven months until now .
*EXP: two years .
*EXP: and we also have recorded your speech as well .
*EXP: um in addition to that .
*EXP: and um basically what this is explaining is with your permission .
*EXP: well go back and analyze the recordings of your speech .
*EXP: um things were looking at .
*EXP: are things like your speaking rate .
*EXP: varieties of words you use .
*EXP: how carefully you might pronounce new words .
*EXP: um and really comparing it when youre talking with Samantha .
*EXP: and when youre talking with an adult .
*EXP: and just seeing the differences in um .
*CHI: lap .
*MOT: my lap ?
*MOT: thank you .
*EXP: you know .
*EXP: how youre speaking to her to encourage her .
*EXP: to start using language .
*MOT: learn the model .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: ice .
*EXP: um so this one just needs initials and date here .
*EXP: and here on a signature .
*MOT: uhhuh .
*EXP: and then .
*EXP: Ill explain the additional one quickly .
*EXP: um so this one is .
*EXP: uh like as I explained its an additional .
*EXP: not part of our study necessarily .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: um but what its explaining is that researchers have been putting .
*EXP: together an international database of child and parent speech .
*EXP: um and language .
*EXP: so what this is asking is if we can use um audio recordings .
*EXP: from these sessions .
*EXP: and use it in that database .
*EXP: so um this one .
*EXP: I just you just .
*EXP: needta check whichever of the three choices .
*EXP: um the first one is not allowing our .
*EXP: you know the data to be uploaded .
*EXP: um meaning it would just be available to us here for this study .
*EXP: um the second one is anonymous transcripts and test score data .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: so that would be we just listen to it .
*EXP: do a written transcription .
*EXP: upload that data .
*EXP: and then the third is a long anonymous audio recordings .
*EXP: the real benefit of that is when were listening for something .
*EXP: were capturing what we hear but .
*EXP: someone else may want something completely different .
*EXP: that were not looking at .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: so um .
*EXP: with both of these options anything identifying would be removed .
*EXP: you said her name .
*EXP: uh her siblings names .
*EXP: anything like that would be removed .
*MOT: so is it one choice or is it both ?
*EXP: um its one of those .
*MOT: so the most accessible would be this one ?
*EXP: right .
*MOT: okay thats fine .
*MOT: thats fine .
*EXP: so um just check any of those three and sign your name .
*MOT: sure .
*EXP: its too small for me .
*EXP: back to you .
*MOT: thank you .
*EXP: and we can let her pick out a prize .
*EXP: or do you wanna pick out her prize ?
*MOT: she can pick out a prize .
*EXP: we probably just have a bunch of two year prizes out here .
*EXP: we dont keep our normal box in here .
*MOT: right .
