*EXP: yeah thats her .
*EXP: thats right thats your mom .
*EXP: well um I dont know how long ago it was that you came for the second visit but .
*MOT: it was like a month .
*EXP: okay so maybe there have been some changes I dunno .
*EXP: that you noticed with what he likes to play with or how hes playing with toys .
*EXP: Im not going to write this down .
*EXP: just gonna capture it .
*MOT: I think um hes starting to learn what things are a little bit more .
*MOT: so youknow he mightve known that this kind of stuff is food I dunno .
*MOT: um we dont have any toys like this at home .
*MOT: any of the food toys .
*MOT: so its different for him .
*EXP: okay any of the xxx or dishes or anything like that okay .
*MOT: I mean he plays when were in the kitchen he plays with the spoons and the spatulas and .
*MOT: but uh otherwise we dont have any of the play foods so thats sorta new to him .
*EXP: okay so he did he seem to like that a lot ?
*MOT: yeah I mean I would point out the animals and he didnt even seem to care about those as much .
*MOT: you like th the food and everything .
*EXP: did he have any favorite foods ?
*MOT: he kept grabbing the uh .
*MOT: the pizza and the hamburger he kept going for .
*EXP: he did .
*MOT: he really liked that pizza .
*EXP: but it doesnt look so much like a real thing do you think he ?
*MOT: I dont think he thinks I I dont know that he would know that its real pizza .
*MOT: I mean all hes ever had is a crust with pizza anyways .
*MOT: so hes never really seen it .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: for some reason he liked it .
*EXP: why do you think he liked those ?
*EXP: hamburger and pizza .
*MOT: um I dunno hes always liked things that are red in color .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: I dunno if that has anything to do with it thats a complete guess .
*MOT: um because then this is sorta boring looking in comparison so .
*EXP: but he liked that ?
*MOT: he liked it he was holding on to this like the whole time .
*EXP: wow okay .
*EXP: um lets see .
*EXP: so would you say the food interested him the most of all the toys ?
*MOT: definitely yeah .
*MOT: where you going Alex ?
*EXP: which things do you think interested him the least ?
*EXP: you can go find your car .
*MOT: I think the books .
*MOT: he likes books at home but usually its when hes quiet .
*MOT: and were sitting .
*MOT: and napping .
*MOT: so for him that was just too slow .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so he wasnt as interested .
*MOT: um he definitely seemed to be interested in the baby .
*MOT: but then as soon as you brought it over he was youknow .
*MOT: he thought it was neat .
*MOT: but uh .
*EXP: he noticed it or something .
*MOT: he definitely noticed it .
*EXP: you noticed the baby interesting .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: but maybe doesnt know how to play with it .
*MOT: hi .
*EXP: thats interesting .
*EXP: a lot of kids seem to be interested in the facial features of the baby .
*MOT: wheres the nose ?
*MOT: wheres the nose ?
*MOT: wheres the nose ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: how about any of these ?
*MOT: he definitely he he remembered this from last time .
*MOT: and thats completely because of the the head .
*MOT: I think he loves loves this texture .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so um this he recognized and this he loved .
*EXP: mom says you like that .
*MOT: bee .
*EXP: xxx bee .
*EXP: were there I I um I think I heard animal names and sounds but I wasnt sure if they were these animals I .
*MOT: um I mean I did a horse sound and a doggy sound .
*MOT: and then youknow we did all the sounds in this .
*EXP: oh in that maybe that was what I was .
*EXP: those are farm ones .
*MOT: and so he knows all the farm animals he knows his rubber duckie at home .
*EXP: does he make the noises yet ?
*MOT: no no .
*MOT: but uh he definitely knows when he takes his bath he knows his rubber duckies .
*MOT: and he has this little crab .
*MOT: and if I say wheres the crab he gives me the crab .
*MOT: so he knows what they are .
*EXP: so he knows what that means interesting okay .
*EXP: uh huh and you pair the sound with the animal .
*MOT: yeah yeah .
*MOT: so I do it often .
*MOT: so he would pick up on it .
*EXP: um and I asked you about differences from last time .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: no over here .
*EXP: they all like that .
*EXP: Ill hafta get a different system for when they get older like you .
*MOT: hey what did I say no .
*MOT: you can play over here .
*MOT: oh that feels good .
*MOT: that feels really good .
*EXP: do you think overall he prefers toys or books at this point .
*MOT: um at this point toys .
*EXP: okay alright .
*EXP: and do you know what um qualities about toys you would say that attract hi attract him ?
*EXP: you mentioned color .
*MOT: I think the texture is probably bigger than anything .
*MOT: um because he likes to put things in his mouth .
*MOT: youknow so he was holding the things that are softer .
*EXP: ah .
*MOT: versus .
*EXP: versus really hard .
*MOT: yeah he wasnt as much .
*MOT: I mean thats a guess .
*MOT: uh he has lots of blocks at home so I was sorta doing blocks with that .
*EXP: youre smiling about that .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: and do you have any dolls at home ?
*MOT: um youknow theyre all not baby dolls theyre animals .
*MOT: so theres like a big puppy big bear but actually no baby dolls .
*EXP: so maybe that was a little its a little different from what hes useta .
*EXP: okay and xxx ?
*MOT: no we fed Alex .
*EXP: oh oh .
*MOT: he fed himself .
*MOT: so he liked drinking from this .
*MOT: except he I think he was disappointed there was no water in it .
*MOT: and uh he ate with a spoon .
*EXP: oh he did very nice .
*MOT: well sort of .
*EXP: he pretended right ?
*EXP: um so do you think he recognizes any of the any of the object names for any of these yet ?
*MOT: of whats here I think he might have recognized this .
*MOT: uh when I called it do you want a drink do you want water .
*MOT: I dont use the term cup very often actually .
*MOT: so he definitely recognized that .
*MOT: um he mightve recognized spoon .
*MOT: but Im not sure .
*EXP: it seems like you played with a variety of things though .
*EXP: um you got around to atl atleast offering most of these kinds of toys .
*EXP: thats great .
*EXP: that is great .
*EXP: um I think thats all I needta ask you at this point .
*EXP: um unless theres anything you noticed that you thought was kind of interesting for us to know um .
*MOT: um I dont think so .
*MOT: I thought it was odd how he was sitting still the whole time at home he never sits still .
*MOT: hes always all over the place .
*EXP: yeah he was right in that frame the whole time .
*MOT: yeah I said oh you wanna see the bee and he just sort of stared .
*MOT: he didnt really go for it .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: now xxx .
*EXP: okay well I think thats all I need .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: and then youre going to come back at when hes two .
*MOT: big difference yeah .
