*MOT: shes like theres something new on your shirt I want that .
*EXP: I know .
*MOT: you cant have that .
*EXP: can I ask mom some questions ?
*EXP: so the first question I have for you is whether youve noticed any changes in her preferences for toys since the last time ?
*EXP: um or whether you think shes playing with the toys differently then she was the last time she was here .
*MOT: um I think the last time we were here she didnt really play she just kinda sat and I just kinda handed her things where now shes pulling things .
*MOT: and now that were done with that youre gonna talk .
*CHI: dada .
*MOT: get down yes get down .
*MOT: um now shes picking .
*MOT: like she wanted the frog she saw it she went after it .
*MOT: she really wants the door knob .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: so while were in here she wants she really likes the door knobs at home .
*MOT: so thats where shes going .
*EXP: and so what does she do just ?
*MOT: she wants to she just wants to get to the knobs any knob .
*MOT: shes very interested in knobs .
*MOT: dresser drawers she pulls them open and dumps all of the clothes out .
*MOT: and we have um an armoire in the living room that has the knobs on .
*MOT: she walks she holds on to the knobs and walks .
*MOT: she really likes door knobs .
*MOT: Im not really sure what it is about the shiny things but .
*MOT: shes into it .
*MOT: she saw it first thats why I kept trying to turn around .
*MOT: she was gonna go for the door .
*MOT: its like I want that .
*MOT: see shes still looking at it .
*EXP: so shed rather have that than any of these toys .
*MOT: than any of it yeah .
*MOT: she would take that if I let her play with that knob the whole time we were here she would play with it .
*MOT: its like you cant have that between that and this microphone .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: alright well clearly there were some other things that interested her besides these but of these toys what do you think she was most interested in ?
*MOT: uh anything that makes noise .
*MOT: so she really liked the keys and the spoons because they make noise .
*MOT: she shook the bottle but it didnt make any noise .
*MOT: right it didnt make any noise ?
*MOT: and she did play with the frog and the rooster .
*MOT: you gonna beat me up with WinnieThePooh ?
*EXP: so she liked um these two things here yeah .
*MOT: the noise .
*MOT: I think they were the only things that made noise .
*MOT: she had the waffles and she banged them and then she put them down .
*EXP: and now she um is looking at something else now that were talking but okay .
*MOT: its because I put her over here .
*MOT: I think when I sat her in the middle theres so many choices .
*MOT: she didnt know .
*MOT: shes familar with the baby doll because we have one at home .
*MOT: so she went straight for that .
*EXP: thats what I was gonna ask you too actually .
*EXP: um of these toys do you have for instance dishes play food or anything like that ?
*MOT: no I actually dont have play food .
*MOT: I thought she was a little young for play food since she still puts everything in her mouth .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: we dont have play food but we have lots of things that .
*MOT: we have keys and things like that that makes noise and little balls that go in the little things and she bangs them .
*MOT: can you say thank you ?
*MOT: no ?
*MOT: youre thinking about it .
*MOT: you cant eat the paper .
*EXP: and so she doesnt have these types of things but she has a baby doll ?
*MOT: yeah she has a doll and she has keys and we have a few stuffed animals but not not very many .
*EXP: and how interested is she in those at home ?
*MOT: um she carries the baby doll around but she leaves it .
*MOT: she likes to bang things .
*MOT: shes really into anything that makes noise so thats why she kept going back to the keys .
*MOT: shes very sociable .
*EXP: so she kept going back to those things that made noise ?
*MOT: yeah thats pretty much .
*MOT: I tried to get her to play with the pizza the book .
*MOT: we have books and stuff at home .
*EXP: do you read them ?
*MOT: at night usually at bedtime .
*MOT: she has her favorite book so she really wasnt I dont usually read during the day but when were going to bed .
*MOT: she gets a book so .
*EXP: if this was more like bedtime .
*MOT: she probably wouldve sat but she sat there but she didnt pull away .
*MOT: she opened this one and then she closed it back because I started reading it she closed it back up .
*MOT: shes like okay Im done with that .
*MOT: and I read this one a couple of these pages of this one .
*MOT: but she wasnt paying any attention so I put it back .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and which of these toys do you think are good for her personality ?
*MOT: um there all probably good for her .
*MOT: she just right now only likes the noise making ones .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: I dont even know why just very interesting .
*MOT: we were just discussing that at home .
*MOT: anything I have maracas they make noise .
*MOT: I have clappers .
*MOT: everything that makes noise a variety of things but she always goes for the noise makers .
*MOT: shes gonna be loud .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: just tells me shes gonna be loud .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: youre very quiet no talking .
*EXP: um which do you think interested her the least ?
*MOT: um I dunno she was into some of them .
*MOT: but not very many .
*EXP: how much xxx .
*MOT: the books .
*MOT: well but I think more because shes accustomed to getting a book at night and its not .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: so youd say the stuffed animals probably ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: do you think there are any of these items that she would recognize the name for ?
*MOT: um outside of the baby doll probably not .
*MOT: and maybe book she probably knows she knows what a book is .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so when I say on the bed .
*MOT: I put the book on the bed and she goes and pulls the book when its time to go to bed .
*MOT: she pulls out we have the global babys book .
*MOT: and it just has pictures of babies in it .
*MOT: and she opens it and points to the babies .
*MOT: so I think she would recognize that book as a book but I dont know that she would recognize other things as a book .
*EXP: I see okay and how about the bottle ?
*MOT: well she is nursed so she doesnt really gets a bottle .
*EXP: so she was interested in it but not because she recognized it ?
*MOT: right we dont normally shes maybe had well she actually had a bottle the other day .
*MOT: so I dont think she was that interested .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: she doesnt recognize it because we dont use it enough .
*EXP: so you think she was looking for it to make noise .
*MOT: yeah she kept turning it over and I think she was interested in the bubbles .
*MOT: but it makes bubbles .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: so once she saw it make bubbles she was trying to get to the bubbles .
*MOT: and now shes trying to open the baby dolls eyes .
*MOT: ours doesnt the eyes dont close on our doll .
*MOT: shes gonna clean it up .
*MOT: shes into everything .
*MOT: back to the bottle .
*EXP: so there were some items you think she probably hasnt seen or heard of before ?
*MOT: yeah probably most of the food .
*MOT: I mean we have real food at home but none of the .
*MOT: like shes seen pizza before .
*MOT: weve eaten the pizza but no it doesnt look like the pizza weve had .
*MOT: but the food I mean we dont I dont know maybe I should get food for home but we dont have we have stuffed animal and baby dolls and books but we dont have the food so .
*EXP: its just more to see whether these are novel items or if there completely new to her or whether they are something she plays with at home or a sibling at home .
*EXP: um thats really .
*MOT: yeah if there were cars in here .
*EXP: um okay and then I think theres one more thing .
*EXP: does she ever pretend to feed the baby doll ?
*MOT: no I havent seen her put anything in any other things mouth .
*MOT: no no Im sure thats coming but probably because she doesnt really take a bottle .
*EXP: right right .
*MOT: so and now she really wants to drink from a cup .
*MOT: a straw or a cup .
*MOT: she would prefer to have either of those .
*MOT: Im getting teeth .
*MOT: yeah say the bottom ones and the top .
*EXP: almost in all the way .
*MOT: Im like Im getting teeth .
*EXP: almost almost .
*EXP: is there anything else ?
*EXP: I think Ive asked all the questions I have .
*EXP: anything else you wanna add or things I should um take note of ?
*MOT: no I know they called and asked if she had um an ear infection .
*MOT: but she didnt and before we came the last time we had just come from the e n t wanted her to have her hearing tested .
*MOT: but she didnt see anything in there .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and .
*EXP: do you have any concerns about her hearing ?
*MOT: no its just where she had the ear infections and the pediatrician sent her .
*MOT: but the e n t said there was nothing in her ears so Im assuming if theres no fluid then .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: but she could probably hear a pin drop .
*MOT: and then that I mean she .
*EXP: her hearing is probably just fine .
*MOT: yeah she definitely if somebody is moving somewhere shes looking to see .
*MOT: whats that ?
*EXP: alright thats all I have um are you .
*EXP: I can take the microphone now .
