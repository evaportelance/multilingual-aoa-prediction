*MOT: yet um we have animals at home .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: that too .

*EXP: that makes sense because he seems very familiar with the farmer and .
*MOT: oh yeah his favorite book is um .
*MOT: uh LittlePeople and it has a barn .
*MOT: and you open the flaps .
*MOT: its a different animals and you try its a open the flap book .

*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: and so he likes stacking those up .
*EXP: and he can get them to click ?
