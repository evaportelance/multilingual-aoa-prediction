*MOT: um and I think he was even like two fisting with the icecream cones .
*MOT: and this time he did not wanna let go of the spoon it seemed like .
*MOT: um and he used it like as a tool against the other toys and stuff .
*EXP: um ah which of the toys seemed to interest him the most besides those would you say ?

*MOT: the most .
*MOT: um other things .
*MOT: I guess the fake food in general .
*MOT: the pizza the peas .
*MOT: the meat .
*MOT: the pitcher .
*MOT: um he was a bit more interested in the books this time .
*MOT: but not a great deal .
*EXP: yeah haha .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: he seemed to like that one .
*EXP: um how about any of the stuffed animals or anything was he into or ?
*MOT: um he wasnt really into them unless I made him be or interacted with it .

*MOT: um but that along with the s the rest of the stuffed animals so .
*EXP: do you think theres like .
*EXP: this is kind of like an interesting question but .
*EXP: do you think theres like a toy that like fits his personality best at this stage ?
*MOT: um usually its things that make noise .
*MOT: so I think he was excited to see the spoon and the pitcher could make a good noise .
*MOT: um he loves putting things in his mouth .
*MOT: so the food definitely goes along with that .
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: and he likes hes pretty social .
*MOT: so things he can be social with too .
*EXP: are a lot of these like foods you have in your house that he would recognize and ?
*MOT: um I think so .
*MOT: we dont have them as toys .
*MOT: but um except for the sweets .
*MOT: hes probably had most of the food .
*MOT: um because just because we we like table food .
*MOT: no purees for you right guy ?

*MOT: Imean not the icecream .
*MOT: but like even an icecream cone .
*EXP: mhm .

*EXP: did a good job .
*MOT: thanks .
*MOT: its funny because .
*EXP: xxx the bee .
*MOT: yeah yeah he loves that hair .
*MOT: its funny coming back here because of course the toys are generally set up the same .
*MOT: but he does interact so differently over the a month or two later .
*MOT: um its different than seeing it at home .
*MOT: youknow day by day you forget but .
*MOT: pretty neat .
*EXP: do you notice like home too you said hes being more into noise and stuff like that .
*EXP: is there anything else that you see his interests are shifting from one thing to another ?
*MOT: sure .
*MOT: um well definitely hes more into moving things now .
*MOT: so he might bring a t youknow go get a toy and then bring it to another area .
*MOT: um yeah you like to stand up too .
*MOT: so sometimes hell play with toys up .
*MOT: and puzzles .
*MOT: we have a shape sorter .
*MOT: and its funny to see him progress with that .
*MOT: its fun and funny .
*MOT: because first we would just took the lid off .
*MOT: and dumped shapes out .
*MOT: and then he started putting shapes into the bucket .
*MOT: and now hes putting shapes into the shape sorter .
*MOT: um so well see if its going in if it goes into the shape sorter lid and then into the bucket .
*MOT: hes not quite there yet .
*MOT: but haha thats alright .
*MOT: youre having fun .
*MOT: so and its funny the shape sorter .
*MOT: because hell realize okay the circle shape goes into the circle hole .
*MOT: and if I take the lid and turn it around hell still put it in that top left corner so .
*MOT: hes figuring it out .
*EXP: thats good .
*EXP: you seem to do a really good job of like explaining things to him and everything .
*MOT: thanks .
*MOT: yeah maybe I overcompensate here .
*MOT: youknow I like to give him some independent play too at home .
*MOT: but its fun .
*MOT: part of the reason to have a baby .
*MOT: is to interact with the toys so .
