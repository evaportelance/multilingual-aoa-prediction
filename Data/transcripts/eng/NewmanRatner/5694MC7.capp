*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: shes all over .
*EXP: oh boy .
*EXP: so .
*EXP: I guess I want first of all your impressions of what you thought most interested her out of these kinds of toys here .
*MOT: probably the books .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: and I think it was more to put them in her mouth .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: she obviously excuse you .
*MOT: didnt want um .
*EXP: want me to hold it for ya ?
*MOT: sure .
*EXP: be better .
*EXP: I think it will still pick up your voice .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: she didnt wanna read them she just wanted to eat them .
*EXP: eat them was there anything in particular that she wanted to eat from these books ?
*EXP: she likes .
*MOT: she likes .
*MOT: the corners of books .
*MOT: I dont know why .
*EXP: any particular book you think ?
*MOT: no I dont think so .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: does she have any books like these this at home ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: anything so do you think that she would like that she recognizes any of these as familiar to her ?
*MOT: well we have the hard book type .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: that she usually has on the floor with her .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and she chews on the corners .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: so you found her the books books were the most interesting for her today .
*EXP: um and what did you think about the least interesting ?
*MOT: um I think probably the baby because shes uh dissuaded from playing with the baby at home .
*EXP: ah got it .
*MOT: theyre kind of off limits .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: yes they are .
*MOT: even her own .
*EXP: oh now you see it .
*MOT: wanna go for it ?
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: and what did shh what do you think about um the stuffed animals ?
*MOT: go for it .
*EXP: how did she .
*MOT: well look at you .
*MOT: she kind of hadta find it on her own she had no interest in anything I gave her .
*MOT: which is fine with me .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: so did she find anything in particular that she liked out of the stuffed animals ?
*MOT: definitely the bee .
*MOT: xxx sticky hair .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: do you think thats why she liked it ?
*MOT: I think so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: the bee had different textures to it .
*EXP: and how about the food and dishes types of toys ?
*EXP: any interest in those ?
*MOT: didnt really have not really .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: shes pretty young but do you think theyre any of those items that she would recognize the names of ?
*MOT: some of this stuff .
*MOT: like tacos and bottle and .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: soup .
*EXP: its okay .
*EXP: I mean you got it right there .
*EXP: you said soup .
*EXP: is she eating any finger foods ?
*MOT: not yet .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: she tries .
*EXP: so uh when she comes back for her next visit soon well see if that changes .
*EXP: that will be interesting .
*MOT: probably .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: and then do you have you said theres babies at home .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: any of these other kinds of toys at home ?
*EXP: she has books hard books .
*MOT: yeah uh stuffed animals we have a lot of but not really where they play .
*EXP: does she have one that shes attached to at all ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: we have this one at home or at my parents house actually .
*EXP: that bee ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: I dont think shes ever played with it she was too young when they got it .
*EXP: so you dont think she likes the sticky hair but its not because she recognizes it .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: unless she has an incredible memory .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um is there anything else I needta .
*EXP: ask ?
*EXP: is there anything that you find that she really enjoys playing with or or exploring at home that we dont have here ?
*MOT: things that make noise the keys kind of do but like a lot of shakers and .
*EXP: mm .
*EXP: some kids find the um pitcher and put something in it and it makes a pretty loud noise .
*EXP: so she would probably like something like that .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: things that give instant gratification .
*MOT: like the feeling of the bee .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*EXP: so very sensory .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: you like that .
*EXP: shh we didnt really she didnt she didnt really play with anything that was very loud this time well see what happens .
*EXP: next time if shes still interested in .
*EXP: making noise .
*MOT: nothing really kept her well except for this .
*EXP: except for this bee so that was .
*EXP: you said the books and then maybe the bee .
*EXP: were the things okay .
*MOT: mhm definitely .
*EXP: and um .
*EXP: Im assuming shes putting things in her mouth at this stage ?
*MOT: everything .
*EXP: everything okay .
*EXP: so that would be how she .
*EXP: interact with a lot most things probably .
*MOT: mhm yeah .
*EXP: not dont dont let that .
*MOT: heres your pacy .
*MOT: yeah we keep the pacifier in her mouth because shes extremely oral .
*MOT: everything goes in .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and everything on the floor happens to be stuff she cant have .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: that must prevent a lot of frustration to have that pacy in .
*MOT: um it does except shell spit it out and find what she cant have .
*EXP: do you do that ?
*MOT: right when I cant be there to rescue it from her mouth .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*EXP: pretty smart .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: pretty smart at seven months old .
*EXP: well um .
*EXP: I think thats all I needta ask you about what she likes to play with and how shes playing .
*EXP: and then when she comes back at her ten month or so visit well probably ask you very similar kinds of questions and um see how it changes for her .
*EXP: but she seems like she might be about done .
*MOT: I think so youre done ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: you ready for a nap ?
*MOT: again ?
*EXP: good work .
