*MOT: so .
*EXP: we get alot of that in these sessions alot of parents have other kids and theyre like youknow we dont really have too much onetoone when I ask them .
*EXP: youknow ?
*MOT: yeah when Wes was born I made sure I had um onetoone with Liam and Liam still gets well actually .
*MOT: when Liam takes his nap sometimes Wes isnt down .
*MOT: but usually then were not really playing were just sortof like hanging out .
*MOT: trying to get him to like .
*MOT: take a nap fall asleep so like .
*MOT: laying laying down .
*MOT: but yeah we dont do alot of onetoone play .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: we do like onetoone nursing and .
