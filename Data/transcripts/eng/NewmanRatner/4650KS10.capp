*EXP: which of the toys seem to be of interest to her than most ?
*MOT: xxx the keys .
*MOT: and the cookies .
*MOT: and the bee .
*MOT: and I guess the bear little bit .
*EXP: have you noticed any changes since the last xxx which I remember included last night .
*MOT: Um .
*MOT: I mean I think it was similar in the sense that like I mean shes not doing a lot of interactive play like imaginative play yet .
*MOT: shes still kind of mostly just exploring everything .
*MOT: um so it seems about the same I mean maybe a little bit more interested .
*MOT: um like like the functions of things like I mean she was able to engage to a limited amount you know a little bit more in the imaginative play but .
*EXP: lets see .
*EXP: which of the toys did xxx the most ?
*MOT: um the books she definitely she was not as interested in .
*MOT: and .
*MOT: I guess just some of the I mean some of the the stuffed animals she didnt they werent as interesting to her they didnt like do things like tickle her or whatever .
*MOT: yeah what do you see hes saying hi to all the animals .
*EXP: lets see which books do you think she would prefer to read or look at like any types of books .
*MOT: um she usually likes the ones that are interactive where she can feel things .
*MOT: um I mean I was surprised that she didnt wanna lift the flaps xxx the peekababy because shes really into peekaboo these days .
*MOT: but I think she was pretty preoccupied with the uh xxx .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: huh .
*EXP: okay do you play with any similar toys at home now ?
*MOT: I mean we have a baby doll that weve since the last time we came weve taken it out and weve played with it .
*MOT: now um but shes still mostly just like would give it kisses and like like look at its eyes and stuff like that .
*MOT: um books we have a lot of um and I dont .
*MOT: I mean we have some stuffed animals but again like we dont play with them too much .
*EXP: okay do you think she prefers books or toys in general ?
*MOT: um I guess toys .
*EXP: and you said you do play with dolls at home now or you have xxx .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and what does she like to do with them ?
*EXP: do you ever pretend to feed them or anything ?
*MOT: um not really again we dont have pretend food yet .
*MOT: um and like the doll doesnt usually come to the table with us when were eating .
*MOT: so no I mean we dont really pretend to feed the baby much but we .
*MOT: you know mostly shell give it kisses and like well talk or whatever .
*EXP: at this point do you think she recognizes any of the items or xxx ?
*MOT: well for sure baby book .
*MOT: um bee maybe .
*MOT: I mean theres enough toys that she has that like have bees on them like Winnie the Pooh bee stuff like that .
*MOT: um so she may recognize that .
*MOT: um puppy she should recognize .
*MOT: but I think she probably recognizes xxx because again we have a lot of like xxx toys so yeah .
*MOT: um and like I said some of the words and the like maybe like the ball and there stuff like that .
*MOT: she knows the word ball but whether she understands it in a two d um thing I dont know .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: thats it all set .
