*MOT: um we have play food .
*MOT: we have uh wooden play food so its just different .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and we have babydolls but theyre in her sisters room so she doesnt usually play .
*MOT: and she n its funny the past three times weve been here she never goes near these toys and her two year old sister has like a whole collection of them and loves them and doesnt let her touch them and even like alone when I try to get her to play with them shes like no .
*MOT: Im like afraid to go there .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: which of these toys does her sister have ?
*MOT: she has .
*MOT: Imean she has alot of toys just youknow small ones like that but she has the sea other and .
*MOT: she has a pink poodle its not exactly the same .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: she has a fox like this .

*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: you love it .
*MOT: um I dont know if shed recognize that we usually give her shredded cheese .
*MOT: or cut up in really tiny thats only the thing other thing I would say is that usually when she does eat everythings cut up really small so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: like the spaghetti wouldnt look like a pile like that for example .
*EXP: yeah um .
*EXP: I know she looked at these books .
*MOT: mhm .

*MOT: um yeah so anytime she can get a hold of my keys she likes to play with those .
*EXP: um lets see .
*EXP: does she she played with those two or is that .
*MOT: I kinda pulled those out and tried to get her to see like would she do it because I was wondering that after the past couple times if shed play with these kinda toys if her older sister wasnt around and she was kind of like wasnt feeling it .
*MOT: either not interested or like conditioned to know not to touch those .
*MOT: and its not like I dont let her play with them at home but just the second she gets them her sister like rips them out of her hand .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: no matter what I try to do so .
