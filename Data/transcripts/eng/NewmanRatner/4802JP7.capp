*EXP: I just wanted to ask you a few questions about what you thought .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: that looked like a good lunch .
*EXP: um lets see well first of all what do you think he was most interested in ?
*MOT: um I think the I think the baby caught his attention .
*MOT: just it was you know something similar .
*MOT: I think he likes looking at other kids so that that kind of caught his attention .
*MOT: we dont have dolls like that at home .
*MOT: so maybe that was another thing that was new .
*MOT: yeah we dont have a baby at home .
*EXP: so you think maybe because it was different ?
*MOT: I think it was it was different and it was it looked like another .
*MOT: I think it was something that he kind of recognized .
*MOT: um and he could he could relate to it .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: like it I think it I think that caught his attention .
*EXP: you were saying Penelope ?
*MOT: oh we have a a friend of ours actually they were the ones that recommended us to call here .
*MOT: um and she looks you know very similar to that .
*MOT: so they play together sometimes .
*EXP: okay is that your playmate ?
*EXP: okay so thats Penelope .
*EXP: so you said you th so okay .
*EXP: so you think that was some something that looked familiar .
*EXP: he could relate to the baby and xxx the baby for that reason .
*MOT: I think so .
*EXP: and then what other toys do you think that he was interested in ?
*MOT: um this toy and I think its because of this funny you know .
*MOT: he touched it and he was really looking at this part of it .
*MOT: I picked it because of the colors .
*MOT: he usually likes that .
*MOT: but he seemed to always whenever this part was just sticking up he .
*EXP: he would go for it ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: so I think its just a interesting look and texture to it .
*MOT: and its easy to grab .
*EXP: thats true its easy to pick up .
*EXP: he sure does seem interested in that .
*EXP: what do you think interested him the least out of everything that you guys looked at ?
*MOT: well the other thing I wanted to mention is something like this where he can pick it up and bang it .
*MOT: like he likes things that because they make that .
*MOT: I think I think because at home too hes like that .
*MOT: if it makes that noise he likes to usually hell take it and hell bang it on on the table .
*MOT: um I dont think he .
*MOT: the stuffed animals kind of .
*MOT: like he would pay attention to it and then hed go onto something else that made noise .
*MOT: so um you know I tried to bring more of these to the table .
*MOT: and he would look at it for a second .
*MOT: and then he seemed to kind of move on .
*MOT: I think noise and texture .
*EXP: youre trying to reach it arent you buddy .
*MOT: here you go .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and also I noticed that the pitcher has a handle .
*EXP: maybe thats .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: the pitcher yup he liked to .
*MOT: and you know like his like his sippycup .
*MOT: he was he puts everything to his mouth but .
*EXP: he was doing pretend drinking ?
*MOT: I think so or he just recognized the handle .
*MOT: and it was easier for him to I think the big thing is it was easier for him to pick up .
*EXP: yeah thats cool .
*EXP: did you I think you looked at a book didnt you ?
*EXP: is that something that hes seen before ?
*EXP: is that one you have at home ?
*MOT: um yeah we do it at bedtime .
*MOT: its alw maybe he associates it with sleep .
*MOT: but its always during naps and bedtime .
*MOT: when we do the books so .
*MOT: um and usually he likes to look at them but not that particular book .
*MOT: yeah I didnt see him really look at the pictures .
*EXP: xxx or hes just not into books right now ?
*MOT: um maybe yeah I dont know if hes just that into a book right now .
*MOT: I usually have him sitting here .
*MOT: and I dont know if me showing it to him maybe had something to do with it .
*MOT: but hes always in my lap and I have it in front .
*EXP: its a little bit different situation .
*MOT: yeah Im not sure if thats it but .
*MOT: okay here you go .
*EXP: you sort of mentioned a few things .
*EXP: I was going to say are there any items that you think he recognized but also recognized the names of .
*EXP: I know you were talking about some of the animals .
*EXP: um do you think he would recognize the name of any of those you showed him ?
*MOT: I dont think so .
*MOT: I havent seen signs of that at home .
*MOT: so I dont think so .
*EXP: okay which ones did you guys look at ?
*EXP: I cant remember .
*MOT: we looked at the frog .
*MOT: um the rooster .
*MOT: the zebra .
*MOT: and there was like a reind deer of some sort .
*MOT: yeah a deer .
*MOT: but um like the rooster theres a toy at home that sings a song about a rooster .
*MOT: and then the frog we have a book about a frog so .
*EXP: and you were making animal sounds for him .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: does he like that ?
*MOT: yeah yeah especial or if we read a book he likes the different different sounds for the different characters .
*MOT: or you know different sounds for the animals .
*MOT: so he seems interested in that .
*EXP: um so you said you dont have any dolls at home but it sounds like you have books that you do at um sleeping time .
*EXP: do you have any of the dishes or um stuffed ani like little um Beaniebaby type animals ?
*MOT: yeah we do .
*MOT: we have um we have some stuffed animals at home .
*MOT: and hell play with them .
*MOT: and usually again thats um .
*MOT: like when we go down when he goes down for a nap or at bedtime we sit on the floor in his nursery .
*MOT: and we look at books and little stuffed animals and he just .
*MOT: maybe thats my fault for breaking stuff up into .
*MOT: you know because the downstairs play stuff is very much the loud the banging stuff the things that make music .
*MOT: and when we go upstairs and hes ready for bedtime we play with stuffed animals and books .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: if it works for you guys its fine .
*EXP: um do you think he prefers books or toys or do you think it depends on um what time it is ?
*MOT: um you know what I actually think that I think he does prefer things that make noise .
*MOT: and um yeah that that definitely gets his attention .
*EXP: and I forget what did you say about the pretend food ?
*EXP: did you do you have anything like that at home ?
*MOT: um well this one .
*MOT: theres a actually we have a a spoon we have spoons this size .
*MOT: and theres one thats purple .
*MOT: he loves to whenever hes eating he loves to play with it .
*MOT: and I let him I say you know you can play with it and then you hafta take three bites and then you can play with it again .
*MOT: so I let him play with a spoon periodically during meals .
*MOT: um and then theres things like tacos .
*MOT: like my husband likes tacos so thats why .
*MOT: um but like I think the spoon was pretty much the only thing that like I kind of let him play with at mealtime .
*MOT: I dont like give him the dish .
*MOT: yeah thats what I thought he might recognize .
*EXP: yeah and he doesnt do dolls at home .
*EXP: um what other category ?
*EXP: do you think he recognized any of the food items you talked about like tacos ?
*MOT: no I dont think so because hes still um hes still eating just like the pureed stuff and yeah .
*MOT: I just was playing .
*MOT: I dont think he recognized it yet .
*EXP: um and then just let me ask you about does he have any nicknames ?
*EXP: I think I heard .
*MOT: his nickname ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: ja Jackaroo .
*MOT: yeah Jackaroo and Booboo .
*EXP: and then you were saying some words in another language too ?
*MOT: yeah um Tagalog .
*MOT: so were trying um .
*MOT: I know random words so whenever I remember them I try and use them .
*MOT: and then we have a book at home um that I read to him at bedtime .
*MOT: and its its English and Tagalog .
*MOT: so it talks about like how to say the word in in a different language .
*EXP: so youre going to be trying to do that as he grows .
*MOT: yeah yeah I dont know it well enough for him to like know exactly how to translate sentences .
*MOT: but Ill like if I know the word for water Ill just insert it into the sentence .
*MOT: thats what my parents did with me .
*MOT: it was kind of English and Tagalog at home .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay thats great .
*EXP: um I think thats all I was .
*EXP: oh you did look at a clock right ?
*MOT: yeah mhm .
*EXP: how was that ?
*MOT: um he looked at it for a little bit .
*MOT: I didnt it didnt catch his attention like I thought it would because .
*EXP: because of the colors .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I thought the colors would be and the eyes .
*MOT: but he didnt .
*MOT: yeah not as not like I thought he would .
*MOT: he didnt respond .
*EXP: maybe when youre in kindergarten well go back to clocks .
*EXP: all right um can you think of anything else we needta ask ?
*EXP: um did you use Spanish ?
*MOT: um no I just Tagalog is yeah thats um .
*MOT: my parents spoke a little bit of it at home .
*MOT: and their fear was that I would get confused .
*MOT: and but I hear that its actually better to do it from the beginning because they wont be confused .
*MOT: so I just try and like I said use it whenever I can .
*EXP: because there were some similar words .
*MOT: yeah its very similar .
*EXP: you know hearing some of those words I thought it was .
*EXP: because youre a Spanish speaker .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: very similar yeah .
*MOT: theres a lot of words that are very similar .
