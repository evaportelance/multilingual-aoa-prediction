*EXP: um so I just have a few questions to ask you and Im not gonna be writing anything down just .
*EXP: because we have um paper trans transcription .
*EXP: um but which of the toys seemed to interest him the most so which do you think .
*MOT: um are you speaking about at home or here ?
*EXP: um here .
*MOT: uh the babydoll seems to have captivated him the most .
*MOT: and um I dont we dont have dolls at the house so this is surprising to me but .
*MOT: well I shouldnt say surprising hes very interested in other children .
*MOT: and so he will immediately um approach them if if I can bring them to him .
*MOT: and interact and so Im I guess Im not so surprised about this .
*MOT: I guess I am surprised that he likes bologna so much .
*MOT: he seems to have gripped onto this quite well .
*MOT: as well as the peanut butter .
*MOT: um and carrot soup but that captivated his interest the most .
*MOT: the face on the on the child on the toy .
*EXP: and um xxx .
*MOT: the stuffed animals .
*MOT: and just because of I in fact thats not fair to say because I didnt bring him over to them .
*MOT: but out of practice he .
*MOT: ah generally doesnt enjoy the stuffed animals quite as much as the things that will make noise when you bang them together .
*EXP: do you think there are any items that he recognizes the name of when you say or ?
*EXP: um are there any items that you played with that hes never heard of before would you say ?
*MOT: hm .
*MOT: peanut butter .
*MOT: any of the the the food goods would have been unfamiliar to him .
*MOT: books hes familiar with .
*MOT: Im not sure these are all different from the ones that we have except for the books .
*MOT: so I would say that everything was unfamiliar except for book .
*EXP: um um so does he generally prefer books over toys ?
*MOT: no um he really enjoys both and it depends on his mood .
*EXP: and .
*MOT: I would say toys over books .
*EXP: and .
*MOT: your baby doll again ?
*EXP: which book um did your did he prefer to look at with you was there a specific one ?
*EXP: just whichever you had ?
*MOT: it would be whatever one I grabbed .
*MOT: and that would be the one that he would wanna grab .
*EXP: okay um I think we basically touched on all of it .
*EXP: so were all through really .
*MOT: yay good job good job .
