*EXP: which toys do you think he liked the least ?
*MOT: um the pretend most of the pretend food yeah .
*MOT: Imean he liked the peas .
*MOT: because of the texture .
*MOT: and it was within reach .
*MOT: but we havent done much or he hasnt done much I dont think with pretend stuff .
*MOT: so xxx like the baby and the baby bottles yeah .
*MOT: does he have any toys like this at home ?
*MOT: we do we have Imean we have GoodNightMoon .
*MOT: we have another KarenKatz book .
*MOT: another BrightBabyBook .
*MOT: some DoctorSeuss .
*MOT: um weve done a little bit with stuffed animals .
*MOT: well he has a few stuffed animals that are like his favorite .
*MOT: um but we dont do were just getting into the stuffed animal thing .
*MOT: and he does not have pretend food .
*MOT: at home I dont think .
*EXP: um do you think theres any items that you think your child recognizes the name of ?
*MOT: um I do think so .
*MOT: um he was excited to see the chicken .
*MOT: and w he has a picture of a chicken in his room right next to his changing table .
*MOT: that he can grab .
*MOT: and we always say .
*MOT: oh youre fighting with the chicken dadadada .
*MOT: so I think he definitely recognized .
*MOT: I think he recognized the name of that .
*MOT: um and hes had keys before .
*MOT: and the duck .
*MOT: and like the the pictures in the BrightBaby we we go through the the names of those .
*MOT: um and Im sure if we had played more with the pretend bottles he wouldve recognized the b word .
*MOT: but ah .
*MOT: or m .
*MOT: I guess we just call it milk we dont call it a bottle .
*MOT: so I dont know .
*EXP: are there any toys you think he doesnt recognize that hes never seen before maybe ?
*MOT: um well he goes to daycare .
*MOT: like a home daycare with a wide age range .
*MOT: age range of kids .
*MOT: um so I dont know if they it doesnt seem to me that they have a lot of dolls there .
*MOT: so like the baby doll I dont think hes familiar with .
*MOT: um I dont youknow so I dont know about the food .
*MOT: um Im sure hes some of it looks very familiar .
*MOT: and like I know hes hes seen it before .

*MOT: but probably toys better .
*EXP: you said you have some of these books at home .
*MOT: right .
