*MOT: um at all .
*MOT: I mean was just I think I remember last time just showing her things and .
*MOT: her just kind of looking at them .
*MOT: but I mean I think she was in the Bumbo seat last time so she couldnt move anywhere .
*MOT: now she kind of you know she wants to touch everything .
*MOT: so definitely a a big difference .
*MOT: she can you know somewhat participate in like the books or playing or .
*MOT: you know show some reaction .
*CHI: no .
*EXP: what were some of the toys um .
*EXP: like that .
*MOT: mm Im sure any of the food I gave her she put in her mouth last time .
*MOT: maybe holding onto a stuffed animal ?
*MOT: but .
*MOT: I dont think she really did anything with the books last time .
*MOT: and neither time she didnt she didnt seem interested in the babydoll .
*EXP: the babydoll just hasnt .
*MOT: yeah no it means I guess nothing to her .
*EXP: um what do you think was her favorite thing this time ?
*MOT: uh probably putting the food in her mouth .
*MOT: the play food .
*EXP: do you think she recognized the names of any of the food items ?
*MOT: uh doubtful .
*MOT: I dont I dont think so .
*MOT: no .
*EXP: which food items did you play with today ?
*MOT: mm .
*MOT: the pizza slices .
*MOT: she played with this .
*MOT: the waffles I think she was banging together .
*MOT: I think she mightve been interested in the liquid .
*MOT: in h in this one .
*MOT: and in this one .
*MOT: she mightve touched this .
*MOT: I think that was it .
*MOT: I dont think we .
*MOT: played with any other food items .
*EXP: and so you dont have food items at home like pretend .
*MOT: yeah we do we do have similar of these I th actually I remember her play with .
*MOT: because I do we have these exact ones at home .
*MOT: this and we have the waffles .

*MOT: at home .
*MOT: so she might mightve recognized those .
*EXP: does she eat any of these foods ?
*EXP: I mean .
*MOT: yeah but everything I give her its like cut up really small so it doesnt resemble .
*MOT: you know any of these .
*MOT: you know the way they are .

*CHI: la la la .
*MOT: the way these are now .
*EXP: right .
*CHI: la .
*CHI: resemble anything .

*MOT: she kindve when we say dog and woof woof like shell look around and look for our dog .

*EXP: with the touching .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: um shh shes usually not interested in books .
*MOT: at all .
*MOT: but if she has theyre like more interactive ones .
*MOT: and this one has something she could touch .
*MOT: and do you have any of these books at home ?
*MOT: we have the foot book .
*MOT: and we have good night moon not this exact good night moon .
*MOT: but um .
*MOT: I dont know how often shes heard them .
*MOT: probably not .
*MOT: enough for her to like remember it .
*MOT: you know maybe I dont a handful of times shes into foot book .
