*MOT: what toys was he most interested in those times ?
*MOT: last time ?
*MOT: the baby and the books .
*MOT: yeah yeah .
*MOT: I think I dont know if he did the keys or the spoons too .
*EXP: and this time what would you say was xxx most attention to ?
*MOT: um the baby and the book .
*MOT: um I mean he paid attention to the keys after I picked them up .
*MOT: but he kept going back on his own to the baby and the book .
*EXP: why do you think that is ?
*MOT: well um um his sister has baby dolls .
*MOT: and she doesnt exactly let her him play with them .
*MOT: so maybe the availability .
*MOT: on the other hand he um he um stays with another baby about about about um six six months old seven months old .
*MOT: and he always seeks the infant out if hes awake at the house .
*MOT: youknow hell hell go go to him and try and touch him and stuff .
*MOT: so it might be that hes youknow um just like a playmate or something .
*MOT: first time Ive seen him um interact with like something a baby item youknow like this .
*MOT: and bring it near the baby doll and um xxx xxx maybe that was just an accident that .
*MOT: and the icecream cone .
*MOT: I dont know if he knows what an icecream cone is though .
*MOT: Im not sure if hes trying to feed the baby or just like hey look or let me hit you on the head with this object .
*EXP: okay so do you think he might be starting to recognize ?
*MOT: I think with the bottle hes starting to recognize because he does spend two mornings a week with a baby who um will take a bottle and and eat .
*EXP: um do you read books at home ?
*MOT: we read books .
*EXP: do you have any of these same books ?
*MOT: we have um goodnight moon I think .
*MOT: and we have some DoctorSeuss but we dont have this particular one .
*MOT: and we have a a touch youknow book .
*MOT: but we dont have that particular one .
*EXP: would you say he prefers book over toys or toys over books ?
*MOT: oh thats hard .
*MOT: they seem to be equally interesting to him .
*MOT: um I would say maybe toys a tiny bit more .
*MOT: because he can manipulate them better youknow .
*MOT: this this I dont see a frustration level with toys .
*MOT: oh like if he wants to open the page and its not quite happening .
*MOT: then hell get frustrated and then turn around to something else .
*MOT: but Ive not seen him frustrated with a toy .
*MOT: like he doesnt expect I dont know I guess he doesnt expect this to do anything .
*EXP: I know you mentioned that his sister has dolls .
*EXP: are there any other dolls that xxx you have at home ?
*MOT: um we have lots of stuffed animals .
*MOT: um I dont see any exact ones .
*MOT: but youknow we have like similar like doggies like this .
*MOT: we have a WinnieThePooh .
*MOT: um he doesnt play very much with stuffed animals at home .
*MOT: um even when I hand them to him .
*MOT: he kinda like looks at it for a while and then he goes .
*MOT: which is interesting .
*MOT: maybe we can cut down on them huh ?
*MOT: um he likes he seems to like things that make a noise .
*MOT: like um a little crunchy noise .
*MOT: or rattling noise or .
*MOT: um and then ah I dont know what he likes about books .
*MOT: maybe the surprise of whats gonna youknow what is he gonna see when he opens the page .
