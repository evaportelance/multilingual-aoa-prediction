*EXP: okay so .
*EXP: um what did he like the best ?
*MOT: apparently that slice of bread .
*EXP: the slice of bread .
*MOT: though he picked up the cookie right away its probably the only thing that looks like something that he eats so far .
*EXP: uh huh .
*EXP: so he he looked he played or whatever um was interested in the other things but maybe not things that he already eats ?
*MOT: no he peas he eats peas .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: just like this so that he would recognize that as a food but .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: most of them hes just picking them up to explore with his mouth .
*EXP: but you said the cookie .
*MOT: not that he would have ever one thats got mandms on top but that shape .
*EXP: like that ?
*MOT: and that color .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: how about things like the spaghetti ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: no .
*MOT: he wouldnt have known what that is .
*MOT: and the bread even hes never had bread that looks like that .
*MOT: hes just picking them up to eat them because he puts things in his mouth .
*EXP: so lets see what did he pick up ?
*EXP: he picked up the cookie .
*EXP: and the peas .
*EXP: and the bread .
*MOT: and the waffles .
*MOT: and .
*MOT: um I dont know if anything else he picked up on his own .
*MOT: the hamburger .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: just kind of curious about the shapes he was going for .
*MOT: uh things that fit nicely in his hand .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: this was too big and this is too big .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: well thats not too big but its too big for him to try to get into his mouth .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*EXP: those straight shapes .
*MOT: the thinner the thinner things .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: I see that works for you .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: um alright so those seem to be what he was interested in more than anything else today .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: some of that is teething .
*EXP: teething yeah .
*MOT: some of it is lunchtime .
*EXP: did he look at any of the um like utensils and uh ?
*MOT: only to use them as noise makers .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: not tee well the spoon he stuck in his mouth but maybe as a a spoon .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: hard to tell .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and does he have anything like that at home or daycare ?
*MOT: um well yes spoons this size but thats about it .
*MOT: I think sometimes in the nursery hell hell see play food .
*MOT: probably puts it in his mouth I dont know .
*MOT: he has these two books at home Im surprised he didnt .
*EXP: oh really ?
*MOT: wanna look at them he usually loves looking through those at home .
*EXP: so he does .
*EXP: are there particular times at home that he likes to uh look at books .
*MOT: I dont know .
*EXP: some people say youknow before bed they read .
*MOT: no he has uh one book we often let him have in his crib .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: it kind of calms but um most of the rest of time hell just be playing and hell one off the shelf and sit down and flip through it .
*EXP: alright so he likes those two but he wasnt interested today .
*MOT: I dont know why .
*MOT: nope .
*EXP: and any other books he showed interest in today ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: okay and any of the stuffed animals did you show him any or did he go for any ?
*MOT: I showed him .
*MOT: okay the chihuahua scares me but I showed him the otter and this goose .
*MOT: he was pretty uninterested .
*MOT: hes not he goes through phases with stuffed animals sometimes he wants to hug them and sometimes he doesnt care .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: how about the baby was he interested at all in that baby ?
*MOT: I didnt even pick the baby up .
*EXP: and he didnt go over there to it .
*MOT: no he doesnt see baby baby dolls very often .
*EXP: so you dont any of those at home ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: but you have some stuffed animals that he likes on and off and he has books that he generally likes .
*MOT: a couple mhm .
*MOT: and the usual baby .
*MOT: like we dont have many of this stuff because its more like toddler toys .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: we mostly have like stacking rings and blocks and stuff .
*EXP: and he likes those ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: how um did you notice any differences in what he liked today or how he played with the toys today compared to the first time ?
*MOT: well last time he didnt show any interest in the food .
*MOT: I think that I think that in the nursery that hes in um twice a week they the older kids have play food and I think sometimes hes been following them around now that he can crawl .
*MOT: so he hadnt noticed it before he was able to crawl but now that he can he gets over to what there playing with .
*MOT: so hes probably seen it .
*EXP: uhhuh so maybe hes its a little bit familiar to him .
*EXP: and hes a little bit more mobile now Im assuming .
*MOT: right right .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: I was surprised he didnt ranged around the room .
*EXP: well that may be next visit .
*MOT: yeah maybe its still a comfort issue stay close to mom .
*EXP: moms not ranging around the room which is good some kids zero in on the wires and then thats it .
*EXP: hard to get it back xxx .
*EXP: well lets see if theres anything else .
*MOT: we try to keep away from wires at home .
*EXP: yeah good .
*EXP: and so do you think he recognizes the names of any of the names of these ?
*EXP: you said he may recognize the peas as something that he eats as food .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: any names ?
*MOT: um of these particular things I dont know he might recognize the words cookie or peas but .
*MOT: not enough to make him look up so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: I think he more recognizes that were going to the place where we keep those things .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: that makes sense .
*EXP: um alright I think thats .
*MOT: if he hears the phrase like .
*MOT: more peas please .
*MOT: then he knows hes getting more to eat .
*MOT: but I dont think he necessarily knows that peas is what hes getting .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: little bit young for that maybe so .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: alright well thats all I needta ask is there anything that I didnt ask you that you think that um we should know about what he likes to play with ?
*MOT: no you dont have many toys that make noise .
*EXP: no we dont it makes the audio hard .
*MOT: I guess so yeah .
*EXP: yeah um .
*MOT: like he lo he has a couple different like he has xylophone two different xylophone toys that he really loves .
*MOT: you know with the mallet .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: stuff like that .
*MOT: did he have toys that you push a button and it makes music or some kind of .
*MOT: not very many .
*MOT: um just because we dont buy them .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: yeah so just ones that were given to us .
*EXP: yeah we dont have very many xxx .
*MOT: I guess yeah that would make the audio .
*EXP: it just makes the yeah xxx .
*MOT: even the stuffed animals arent really animals that make a lot of noise .
*EXP: no I dont think any of these make any noise .
*MOT: so usually if I pick up an animal I would do a noise or something with it .
*EXP: press a .
*MOT: no I mean .
*EXP: oh you would make a noise .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: whatever noise the animal makes but .
*EXP: some of the things like the otter .
*MOT: an otter and I dont know what noise a zebra would make .
*EXP: well the frog some people do the frog .
*MOT: frog and he chicken .
*EXP: and the chicken and the dog .
*EXP: but yeah thats that might be a bear .
