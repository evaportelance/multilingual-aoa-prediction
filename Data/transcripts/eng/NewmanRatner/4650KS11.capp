*MOT: I had some too .
*MOT: I got some too .
*MOT: what do you see do you see someone over there ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: so first of all what do you think has changed since last time ?
*MOT: um I think she is getting a little bit better at like some of the pretend play I mean like feeding the fact that she fed the baby thats the first time Ive seen her do that .
*MOT: that was that was pretty impressive .
*MOT: um I think her receptive language has improved a little bit since last time .
*EXP: so you think she knows some of the words you were talking about ?
*MOT: yeah well I think just understanding like I dont know I guess just like youknow give the you know give it to the baby or youknow whatever I mean she just I dont know obviously she probably wouldnt understand all those words but .
*MOT: understood the ideas behind it some more .
*MOT: so still a lot of these things are foreign to her I mean she has eaten peas finally but I dont know that Ive labeled them for her .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: yeah yeah .
*MOT: yeah is the baby eating ?
*MOT: thats her sign for eat .
*MOT: hi baby .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: is there anything else here that you would think that she particularly recognize from being from having at home ?
*MOT: I mean the pretend food we dont have at all um .
*MOT: and like I mean the only food like the cup like she has a cup and we dont drink juice but she has a cup and she drinks that a lot more now so .
*MOT: that was probably more familiar and we do read goodnight moon so even though this was a different version she I think she recognized some parts of it and she definitely showed a lot more interest in the pages that looked like .
*MOT: the copy that we have than the ones where it was like counting and she definitely didnt seem interested in those ones .
*EXP: its a book .
*EXP: book .
*MOT: and the pages that looked like in the book she was more interested in those um .
*MOT: and puppy I mean she knows and I think she she knew that one last time too .
*MOT: shes known that one for awhile .
*MOT: um I dunno I mean shes everytime we come she loves the pretend food and we still dont have any pretend food but I feel like thats something that we definitely probably needta get her at some point soon .
*MOT: cause she does seem to show a pretty good interest in it although I think most of it is just teething and mouthing .
*MOT: well youknow I can be shaped into good play .
*EXP: um I noticed you were doing a lot of body parts .
*EXP: is that something youve been working on ?
*MOT: just recently yeah we Ive been trying to start getting her especially the facial ones like eyes nose mouth .
*MOT: trying to get her to to recognize some of those I mean I dont I dont think she knows them yet but I mean I think shes starting to be more familiar with the words .
*MOT: hearing me say them .
*MOT: cause like when I say oh look its so and sos eyes .
*MOT: she tends to look to see what Im pointing at so .
*MOT: maybe she knows it but I think shes just starting to be familiar with the word but not necessarily knowing what it means .
*MOT: you have a cup ?
*MOT: and spoons um she she has weve attached some measuring spoons so whenever she eats she gets to play with those so thats a familiar toy which I dont think she had last time .
*MOT: so yeah yeah you get to play with your spoons huh ?
*MOT: yeah spoons .
*MOT: hi baby hi baby .
*EXP: of all the stuffed animals xxx picked out three in particular .
*MOT: the puppies and the frog cause she seemed to love frogs I mean we have a couple different frog things at home and she seems to and just this last week she started cause I try to do some science and xxx for a frog .
*MOT: and just this last week she started when I talk about frogs shell stick her tongue out she didnt do it this time but its a frog .
*MOT: you see the frog .
*MOT: yeah and we do sing that little song usually whenever we see a frog so she likes that .
*MOT: like that can you do ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: your going to say it but you arent going to do the tongue now but she does she does .
*MOT: where shes I think shes xxx .
*MOT: frog yeah .
*MOT: yay yeah frog .
*MOT: and then puppies like I said she knows and like so and she has stuffed animals of puppies too so .
*EXP: you have do you have a dog at home ?
*MOT: yes we do have a dog at home .
*MOT: yeah yeah we do have a cat at home too but she doesnt like I think she started like sometimes shell imitate like kitty an approximation of the word for me but puppy shes definitely more interested in the dog than the cat .
*MOT: she likes to yell at him actually just like she yelled at the puppy dog the the stuffed animals .
*MOT: you love your puppy ?
*MOT: your puppy ?
*MOT: yeah your puppy ?
*MOT: thats not a puppy thats a frog xxx .
*MOT: yeah its a puppy .
*EXP: so you said that the spoons were something that you newly youve gotten since like the last time that you were here as a toy is there anything else thats a new toy xxx ?
*MOT: um I dont think so youknow not similar to what you have here .
*MOT: I dont think so .
*MOT: are you hiding oh I see you I see you .
*EXP: well I think that is it um .
*EXP: so this was the third visit .
*EXP: the final one .
*EXP: for this period in your life um .
*EXP: um and um yeah when she gets closer to two years um .
*EXP: thats when we will start looking to see whether any of these different things that these different skills relate to how shes learned .
*EXP: what she youknow what kind of vocabulary she has and she developed over .
*EXP: over time um .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: although probably not big for a two year old cause she still seems to be she stays small for her age .
*MOT: tall but skinny .
*MOT: yeah its true .
*EXP: my brother was the chubbiest baby ever he was so fat he just had rolls upon his rolls and yet .
*EXP: hes one of the skinniest adults .
*MOT: what do you see the frog ?
