*EXP: you having fun ?
*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: so I have the same round of questions .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: that I hafta read as last time .
*EXP: um one of the first things we like to ask is do you notice if you remember what she played with last time .
*EXP: if you r um did you notice any changes ?
*MOT: um I think shh I think she might have remembered some of these .
*MOT: um because I could just tell by her reactions .
*EXP: yeah ?
*MOT: yeah it seemed like especially the bee .
*MOT: um but maybe she was a little more um maybe because she was like a little f familiar with the area and the toys .
*MOT: like she she was like going out and grabbing them on her own .
*MOT: um whereas before I was like handing them to her I think .
*EXP: were there any specific ones that you found she played with now and not last time ?
*MOT: last time ?
*MOT: ah no I dont think so .
*MOT: I remember last time she played with the animals and the food .
*MOT: and that seemed to be what she was interested in this time also .
*MOT: although actually she was the spoons and the keys .
*MOT: I dont know if the spoons were here last time .
*MOT: but the keys were here last time .
*MOT: and she was having a lot more fun with these today .
*MOT: ah how about books here and at home .
*MOT: shes not she her attention span isnt really um .
*MOT: we have trouble getting through a full book with her .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: um yeah I could tell .
*MOT: I think books were at the bottom of her list today .
*MOT: theres just too much other stuff for her to look at .
*EXP: Im sorry do you have any of the books at home ?
*MOT: these books ?
*MOT: yeah we do .
*MOT: we do have some of these books .
*MOT: but I dont know if shes ever .
*MOT: I dont think weve gone over these books these particular ones with her .
*MOT: with her sister we have .
*MOT: but um yeah I dont think we dont have any of these exact ones .
*MOT: that that weve gone over with her .
*MOT: like her her books generally are um like .
*MOT: because these are a little bit more advanced .
*MOT: I dont know her books the ones we do at have at home are like four pages long .
*EXP: the inflatable or like the touching ?
*MOT: um yeah we have an inflatable one that she likes .
*MOT: but theyre also cardboard .
*MOT: just like real quick with youknow like an animal on each page or something .
*MOT: um not where you hafta word read multiple words .
*MOT: she thats when she starts to lose her um lose focus on the book .
*EXP: do you think um shed recognize any of the names of the animals today ?
*MOT: ah maybe .
*MOT: she knows I I think she kindof knows dog .
*MOT: because we have our dog .
*MOT: um and like the like woof woof .
*MOT: she knows to associate with with the dog .
*MOT: um but I think she remembered the bee .
*MOT: for sure .
*MOT: um but I dont know about like names of the animals .
*MOT: maybe the bee .
*MOT: probably more the sounds though that I make with him .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I was doing that with her last time .
*MOT: she seemed to remember that .
*EXP: and I um noticed that a couple times rather than saying dog you used either the type of dog or a dog name .
*MOT: oh yeah the dogs name .
*MOT: yeah our dogs name Tasmin .
*MOT: so thats Ive been going over like Tasmins a dog .
*MOT: and he says woof woof .
*MOT: so I was trying to get her to kindof although um .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: Tasmin doesnt look like either of these dogs .
*MOT: but my parents .
*MOT: who she sees my parents a few times a week .
*MOT: they have a poodle .
*MOT: not a pink poodle but haha .
*MOT: um named Frio .
*MOT: so I was thinking maybe shed get get that out of this .
*MOT: but I dont know .
*MOT: probably not .
*EXP: so and the bear .
*MOT: the bear .
*MOT: yeah she um I dont know if she really knows who WinnieThePooh is .
*MOT: but shes we went to Disneyworld in March .
*MOT: and we saw lots of WinnieThePooh there .
*MOT: but I doubt if she remembers that .
*EXP: do you have stuffed animals at home ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: lots of animals at home .
*EXP: how do you usually play with them at home ?
*MOT: um same thing .
*MOT: just like having like youknow rubbing them against her and ticking her .
*MOT: so shh shes a big fan of the stuffed animals and hugging them .
*EXP: and um the play food that seemed to be .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: the play food shell just wanna eat .
*MOT: she really likes to eat .
*MOT: so anything that looks like cooking food shes going to test it out .
*MOT: ah so I think she doesnt youknow doesnt know the difference between pretend food and real food .
*MOT: um but pretty much the food we feed her at home is cut up into small pieces .
*MOT: so I dont think she would make the association between what shes eaten and the play food .
*EXP: that makes sense .
*EXP: are is there anything that would be .
*EXP: I know last time you said she loves everything .
*EXP: is there a favorite food here ?
*MOT: honestly she would eat any of this .
*MOT: ah she does like noodles .
*MOT: either noodles or cheese .
*MOT: would probably be out of whats here would probably be her favorite .
*MOT: although shed quickly eat up anything else .
*EXP: you said you didnt have play food at home ?
*MOT: yeah we do .
*EXP: how do you play with that usually ?
*MOT: ah well its pretty much just in her sisters play kitchen .
*MOT: shell just go over to the kitchen and pull it out and chew on it .
*MOT: and so we dont really yeah we dont really play with her with the food .
*MOT: she just kindof gets it out herself .
*EXP: you use it to like feed the animals or ?
*MOT: oh yeah .
*MOT: ah she does .
*MOT: I dont know if she really understood that .
*MOT: she does like to take whatever shes eating and put it to my mouth .
*MOT: and she likes me to pretend that Im eating her food .
*MOT: well she thinks Im eating it but .
*MOT: okay Isabelle off the chords .
*MOT: your favorite thing here .
*MOT: yeah oh what is that ?
*EXP: speaking of that what do you think was her favorite thing today ?
*MOT: either the bee or the dogs .
*MOT: those seemed to really entertain her for a while .
*MOT: just had lots of hugs for the for the dogs .
*MOT: I think she likes the texture of this .
*MOT: its like a different rubbery texture .
*EXP: oh thats good .
*EXP: do you think that gets her a lot ?
*EXP: like xxx xxx a book or something ?
*MOT: textures ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: defin yeah the textures and also the colors .
*MOT: I think this has some youknow bright colors and contrast to it .
*EXP: and the sounds ?
*MOT: yeah definitely yeah sounds .
*MOT: absolutely .
*MOT: and I feel like she knew what to do with the spoon .
*MOT: she was putting that right in her mouth .
*MOT: although youknow well give her well feed her .
*MOT: but well give her a spoon to play with .
*MOT: and she tries to pick up the food and with the spoon and put it in her mouth .
*EXP: okay and do you think .
*EXP: you said you think she recognized the bee but um .
*EXP: I think I may have asked this xxx .
*EXP: but do you think she would recognize the names .
*EXP: as in if you said it out loud she would look at it or know what youre talking about ?
*MOT: maybe the dogs .
*MOT: oh Isabelle .
*MOT: um I think maybe dogs she would she might do the association .
*MOT: but I dont think anything else she would really .
*MOT: Imean I guess shh shes heard the words before .
*MOT: but I dont think she could put two and two together .
*EXP: what do you think is the least is the thing she liked the least ?
*MOT: probably the baby doll .
*MOT: yeah Isabelle .
*MOT: Isabelle .
*MOT: thats yeah I know .
*MOT: come on .
*EXP: and how do you usually deal with youknow if she gets is disinterested in something ?
*EXP: how do you get her to come back to you ?
*MOT: to get back to that ?
