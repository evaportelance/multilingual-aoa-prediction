*EXP: alrighty so Im gonna ask you some questions now .
*EXP: um which of these do you think interests her the most ?
*MOT: the food and these spoons .
*EXP: and do you think thats similar or different than the last visit ?
*MOT: very similar to the last time .
*MOT: I dont remember the first time but last time she definitely stayed with mostly the food .
*EXP: okay was there any food in particular that she really liked ?
*MOT: um Id say the pizza .
*MOT: mostly the pizza and then the spoons which arent food but the kitchen stuff .
*MOT: okay um which do you think is a good toy for her personality ?
*MOT: for her personality oh wow thats a different question .
*MOT: um whats a good toy for your personality ?
*MOT: I really dont know what Id say to that one .
*MOT: because it amazes me that she sits in this one spot and doesnt move around to play with all these toys .
*MOT: yeah it doesnt work at home this we I would hafta start surrounding her .
*MOT: which toy is good for your personality ?
*EXP: I mean its okay if you dont know .
*MOT: I dont .
*EXP: thats kinda a weird question .
*EXP: um which do you think seemed to interest her the least ?
*MOT: the least ?
*MOT: everything or the ones I tried out for her ?
*EXP: um either .
*MOT: well she seemed to have no interest in this earlier when I tried to play with these .
*MOT: until just now .
*MOT: and the book today which is surprising because she usually joins us when we read at home .
*MOT: because she has two older brothers so we do books .
*MOT: and shes usually right in the middle of them either turning them or listening .
*MOT: so I was surprised when I pulled out these two that she has no interest .
*MOT: now youre gonna go go ahead .
*EXP: does she play with similar toys at home ?
*MOT: um not to the food .
*MOT: because we dont have any food at home .
*MOT: um thats not true once in a while she plays with the fake apples we have but its not usually in the toy area .
*MOT: um books usually .
*MOT: um once in a while a baby doll .
*MOT: a little bit smaller baby doll .
*EXP: thats like her size .
*MOT: um so yeah I think we needta go get food because it does seem to always interest her here .
*EXP: um what does she generally like to do with dolls at home ?
*MOT: she doesnt often play with her dolls shell just kinda hold it a little bit but then its not one of her favorites .
*MOT: um she typically plays with more the musical interactions toys or vehicles with her brothers .
*MOT: actually thats like a typical one playing with cars versus a doll .
*EXP: um do you think she recognized any of the names of these objects ?
*MOT: um when I said the drink and she put that to her mouth .
*MOT: made me think she was I was surprised that she did that .
*MOT: um I mean she does have cups and bottles at home but it surprised me that she put that right to her mouth .
*MOT: other than that I dont think she really knows the names of the other ones .
*EXP: okay would she be familiar with any of the stuffed animals like Winnie the Pooh or the ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: not by like name or xxx .
*EXP: um is there anything else that you xxx ?
*MOT: um that she doesnt usually sit this still with a group of toys around her .
*MOT: I want her to do this at home when I need her too .
*MOT: um when I wanna work sit and play .
*MOT: um no I dont think so .
*MOT: other than she must love this food and I hafta go by new toys .
*MOT: no she likes the food you like that ?
