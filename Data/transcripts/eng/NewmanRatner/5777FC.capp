*MOT: no I really well maybe the habitat for the animal thing I tried to um say oh look you can play with the animals on here .
*MOT: but other than that I I kind of had a feeling hed go for the cooking ?
*MOT: maybe I directed that a little bit ?
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: um but I just kinda let him do his own thing .
*EXP: and then is there anything that he plays at home that we really didnt see here ?
*MOT: tried to .
*MOT: oh it is ready .
*MOT: oh thank you .
*MOT: careful it might be hot .
*MOT: careful .
*MOT: um he does play with more cars and trucks and buses and trains and stuff than we saw here .
*MOT: but but he talked about those a lot so .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: I think we also I think we get a lot of vroom .
*MOT: vroom ?
*MOT: oh yeah .
*EXP: and then not not as many words .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: so for us those are not ideal .
*MOT: sure .
*MOT: sure .
*MOT: um but yeah Imean we played with the blocks before and he does a lot of block building and stuff so .
*MOT: Im trying to think what else .
*MOT: I think thats about it .
*EXP: do you have any questions about xxx ?
*MOT: um was it only language based or was some of it intelligence i q stuff too ?
*EXP: um well thats a trickier question .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: it isnt were were doing language .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: and then were also doing a fine motor fine motor and um kind of visual acuity .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: same and different .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: and um those are both portions of a big group of test called the Mullin which when given as a big whole they use as a stand in for i q test .
*EXP: but were mostly interested in those we didnt do the whole thing .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: we just do those little bits .
*MOT: more animals ?
*EXP: theres some more in the other boxes .
*EXP: you can look .
*EXP: are there some more in this box ?
*EXP: whos in there ?
*MOT: alright .
*MOT: thats good I was afraid he was getting sad for a second .
*EXP: um and and those are to um remember in his little baby tests he looked at things on the screen where there were little blocks that move around and shapes ?
*MOT: right .
*EXP: and so this is kind of the kids .
*MOT: no because I was blindfolded .
*EXP: oh thats true Im so sorry .
*EXP: well they shouldve actually shown you .
*MOT: no just kidding they told us about it .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: they told us about it .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: but um this is a kind of older kid version of that and the fine motor they see .
*MOT: octopus .
*EXP: expressive variant of that .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: like the way that we did receptive vocabulary where you find something and we did expressive where you tell me what it is .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um theres the visual acuity thats kind of expre um thats kind of receptive you saw the difference .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: and the fine motor is a kind of more active correlate to that .
*EXP: so were doing those because they correlate to that .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: and then he also did the listening tasks .
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: oh Francis .
*MOT: can you put this back in the sink please ?
*MOT: Im finished .
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: Im finished .
*EXP: oh we could clean it up .
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: and thats more what the language part scores correspond to .
*EXP: in particular the um pretend penguin names .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: where we mix up syllables and see .
*MOT: yeah that reminded me of one of the tests or whatever .
*EXP: so those things are sposta go together .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: and then um were absolutely at the end xxx .
*MOT: great .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: and um .
*MOT: excellent .
*MOT: and I hafta send in those forms to you Im really sorry .
