*MOT: her brother likes it so she watches this .
*MOT: so I thought Ive never seen these before .
*MOT: these are really cool .
*MOT: I thought they might be int she might be interested in them just because she watches the show .
*MOT: but she didnt care about them today .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: yeah but normally she likes she likes little stuffed animals and stuff .
*MOT: but she never has a very long attention span for them .
*MOT: shell just look at them and kiss them and hug them and then put them down .
*MOT: so thats about it .
*MOT: she really doesnt play play with them yet .
*EXP: does she have any of those same ones ?
*MOT: she has she has this PoohBear .
*MOT: um I know she was PoohBear .
*MOT: she has a a poodle that looks exactly like this its just a little bit bigger .
*MOT: so she saw that one and she liked it .
*MOT: but thats about it .
*MOT: she really doesnt have .
*MOT: she has some puppets at home thats why she was playing with the puppet .
*MOT: but otherwise she doesnt have them .
*EXP: did she have does she have any of those same books ?
*MOT: we have GoodnightMoon .
*MOT: um but we dont have the counting one .
*MOT: um and we have we have PutMeintheZoo .

*EXP: xxx but we wont do that um do you wanna start telling me what you started with today .
*MOT: okay .
*MOT: she went straight to the babies .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and which kinda surprising to me because at home she kind of ignores her babies .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: because she wants to play with whatever her brothers playing with .
*MOT: especially around babies so it was kinda neat to see her wanna play with them .
*MOT: because I encourage it Ill be like oh lets feed your baby xxx your babys crying and shell do it and then shell like eh and run off and play with her brother .
*MOT: so I was glad to see that so .
*MOT: I know now when I have her one on one that she wanted to play with babies .
*MOT: um then she wanted to play with the magnets but she didnt really show much interest in that usually she loves animals .
*MOT: like shell go to animals before the babies at home .
*MOT: we have alot of these w thats why I was kinda surprised she went to the babies today first maybe she didnt notice the animals right away but .
*MOT: at home shell play with the animals .
*MOT: and shell like take little doggies and put them in a little pen and play with them like that or things like zoos so .
*MOT: so then we did that .
*MOT: oh screws she likes .
*MOT: Gabe also has a tool set so thats probably why she and he .
*MOT: at home I wont let her play with it so thats maybe why she wanted to try that out but .
*MOT: um so that and at home she loves to play with her kitchen set .
*MOT: and cook me things and shes always bringing me things shes cooked and .
*MOT: now so like yeah .
*MOT: thats why she really loves doing that so .
*EXP: um okay so just with so with the babies what was she really doing with them today ?
*MOT: she liked clothes .
*MOT: dressing them yeah putting clothes on them .
*EXP: mhm .
