*EXP: Im not gonna write anything down because youre miked and so well just go back write everything down .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: okay so which of the toys seemed to interest her the most ?
*MOT: the hard ones .
*MOT: yeah the food toys yeah .
*EXP: right xxx .
*MOT: shes teething alot .
*MOT: she has four teeth and she has two more coming in on the top .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: um and I think just tactile wise shes much more interested in these right now than soft toys .
*MOT: we have both at home and she gravitates more to the harder things .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: what do you think is a good toy for her personality ?
*MOT: her personality ?
*MOT: hm .
*EXP: xxx question .
*MOT: out of these ?
*MOT: or just in general ?
*EXP: um mostly out of these I guess .
*MOT: out of these .
*MOT: I dont know know what to .
*MOT: Imean .
*EXP: I think thats a kindof strange question .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: um like at home she likes to play like we have alot of plastic toys like this like we have a kitchen with plastic play food that she really likes .
*MOT: and we also have this she has her sister just got this plastic doll house that she really likes .
*MOT: um she likes to have like alot of different feelings and textures and .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: colors so I think thats probably .
*MOT: and like I said hard things youknow .
*MOT: I dont know how that matches up with her personality like I feel like shes really inquisitive and busy .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so I dont know how that relates but .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: cool no thats good .
*EXP: what do you think seemed to xxx the least .
*MOT: um probably the soft toys .
*MOT: she had looked at the books a little bit but like shes not .
*MOT: which is a good thing because her sister is like obsessed with those right now .
*MOT: her sisters two so she steers clear of them and .
*EXP: oh okay .
*MOT: that works out well in our house .
*EXP: has she seen any of these books before ?
*MOT: um a couple of these we have alot of these kindof books at home .
*MOT: like the lift the flaps we dont have this one exactly .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: hers are mostly missing most of the flaps at this point .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: um but she likes she likes that kindof .
*EXP: peekaboo ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and we have GoodNightMoon .
*MOT: she didnt look at that one though .
*MOT: we dont have these two which is why I brought those over to see if shed check those out .
*MOT: and we dont have any of this exact food .
*EXP: no .
*MOT: a couple of the animals we have .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: cool .
*EXP: lets see next question .
*EXP: um does she play with dolls at home at all ?
*MOT: uh the little like little people dolls .
*MOT: like FisherPrice ones .
*MOT: um but she hasnt been too interested in bigger dolls like this .
*MOT: although she was interested in the baby today thats xxx .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: its funny because the baby was like the same size as her .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: I was like oh my gosh shes in trouble .
*EXP: do you think that she wouldve recognized any of the food that she played with ?
*MOT: she hasnt eaten any of that food Imean shes just really on um .
*MOT: like shell eat toast .
*MOT: sometimes but shes like the solids that shes on are all still purees that I make her so .
*MOT: probably not .
*EXP: probably not .
*MOT: like when I was saying pizza she probably .
*EXP: or icecream ?
*MOT: no she hasnt really had that yet either her first she got some icing at her sisters birthday party yesterday and that was like her first sweet treat .
*EXP: mm .
*MOT: so she hasnt she probably wouldnt and youknow shes probably just putting it in her mouth because of the teething .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: okay at this point do you that think shed recognizes any of the names of the items ?
*EXP: um or is beginning to recognize the names of them ?
*MOT: these are all most of these are new .
*MOT: foods .
*MOT: the ones that we played with .
*MOT: like pizza .
