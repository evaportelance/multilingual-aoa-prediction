*MOT: okay I think we made it through most of the toys .
*EXP: yeah thats great .
*EXP: really great .
*EXP: um and now I just have a few questions .
*EXP: and I wont write down the answers .
*EXP: Ill just let the microphone pick it up for me .
*MOT: oh okay .
*EXP: um the first question is which of the toys seemed to interest your child the most ?
*MOT: well he liked to manipulate this book a lot .
*MOT: I think he definitely likes the physical manipulation of that .
*MOT: and he tends to like things .
*MOT: usually actually one of his favorite toys is a ball .
*MOT: so he seems to like things that he like that he can hold in his hand like this .
*MOT: um I dont know .
*MOT: I would say hes not that real big on stuffed animals but probably the the little things that he can manipulate in his hand .
*MOT: thats probably a real long answer for a simple question .
*EXP: no perfect .
*EXP: um which is a good toy for his or her personality his personality .
*MOT: ah haha anything that is mechanical in nature and anything that he can kinda chase after .
*MOT: things that use his fingers and things like I said balls .
*MOT: ah but of the of the toys that are here ?
*MOT: I think this bucket and this book because theyre littler things that he can kinda look at and take in the crevices on them .
*EXP: okay great .
*EXP: why do you think it interests him ?
*MOT: he just seems to have a nature that is constantly interested in ah moving things around .
*MOT: he himself and little objects and things like that .
*MOT: he loves to shake things and bang things and .
*EXP: okay and you already touched on which of the toys seemed to interest him the least .
*EXP: um I know you said stuffed animals anything else or .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: some expert is probably going to watch this and say .
*MOT: oh that mom doesnt know her kid at all .
*EXP: haha not at all .
*MOT: um no I mean he didnt seem he likes stuffed animals usually like what I was doing with his face .
*MOT: thats he likes how soft they are but .
*EXP: uhhum .
*MOT: hes not I dont think hes into them for the look of them .
*MOT: maybe when he gets a little older .
*MOT: so Id probably say the stuffed animals interest him the least .
*EXP: okay and why do you think that is ?
*MOT: I think its because theyre sort of inanimate .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: which book did or would your child prefer to read aloud with you ?
*MOT: definitely this one because he likes .
*MOT: if he if hes willing to sit and look at a book .
*MOT: and probably we didnt get to this one .
*MOT: but he probably would have liked this one a little bit .
*MOT: he likes the touch and feel and the lift the flap thing .
*MOT: thats that seems to be more his interest in books .
*EXP: okay and were there any items you think your child didnt know the name of ?
*MOT: all of the above no ?
*MOT: ah didnt know the name of ?
*MOT: probably the majority of these he does not know the name of .
*MOT: I dont know I try very hard when were playing to kind of tell him the names of things .
*MOT: but I think its all still connecting up there .
*EXP: alright okay .
*EXP: and do you have any toys like these at home ?
*MOT: we do .
*MOT: I actually dont play with toy food with him very much at home .
*MOT: I obviously do books with him .
*MOT: and he has stuffed animals that we play with .
*MOT: and ah yeah we my older daughter plays more with the toy food than he plays with the toy food .
*EXP: okay and do you think your child prefers books or toys ?
*MOT: yeah I would say toys .
*EXP: okay and do you ever play with pretend food or pretend to feed dolls at home ?
*MOT: well well do .
*MOT: I have a three year old daughter .
*MOT: so well sometimes have tea parties .
*MOT: and well do things like that .
*MOT: or hell see her doing that .
*MOT: but I would I would not tend to sit down with him with this doll and like pretend to .
*MOT: also hes breast fed exclusively .
*MOT: so he doesnt really know that much about bottles .
*MOT: I mean hes taken a bottle a few times .
*MOT: but no it wouldnt I wouldnt think to do that at this age .
*MOT: maybe I should .
*MOT: who knows .
*EXP: not implying anything haha .
