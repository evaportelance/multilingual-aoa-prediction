*EXP: mhm okay .
*EXP: so which of the toys seem to interest Caroline the least ?
*MOT: the books .
*EXP: the books ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: and why do you think that ?
*MOT: I think its uh my older daughter was like this too and like for a certain period of a couple months .
*MOT: shes just too um antsy to to sit and look at a book .
*MOT: like if if you could be mobile and use a book she she would be better off I think .
*EXP: okay so one of the questions is do you think she prefers books or toys ?
*MOT: toys definitely .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: if you hadta pick a book which book did she prefer to look at with you ?
*MOT: uh of the ones here ?
*MOT: oh honey .
*MOT: the book that we were looking at before you guys came in she liked a lot .
*MOT: it was like a pop up and a tactile one .
*MOT: but then this tactile one I think I think her being in the in the seat .
*MOT: made it hard for her to sit .
*MOT: do you want me to take her ?
*MOT: what happened ?
*MOT: what happened ?
*MOT: that was a close one .
*MOT: I do have a Binky with me but I dont know where I p .
*MOT: oh no its in here .
*MOT: alright you .
*MOT: um and Im also guilty of not reading too many books with her lately .
*EXP: uhhum .
*MOT: um because I because its hard .
*MOT: she squirms out of my lap and stuff .
*MOT: so .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: Im not sure if that was what you were questioning me about or not .
*EXP: um do you have any toys like these at home ?
*MOT: um yeah we have a lot of soft toys .
*MOT: um we dont have any puppets .
*MOT: I might try puppets .
*MOT: and her older sister plays with all the play food and stuff which she of course doesnt you know do pretend play .
*MOT: but she mouths a lot .
*MOT: and we do have books all over .
*MOT: but shes not interested in books at home like on her own either .
*EXP: does she ever play with dolls at home ?
*MOT: um she climbs on them haha .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: but no not yet .
*MOT: not in any meaningful manner .
*EXP: thats about it .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: thank you very much .
*MOT: youre welcome .
*EXP: for coming .
*EXP: just a couple things that she played with I could ask you .
*EXP: it looked like she did a lot of playing with the kitchen stuff like the food and stuff .
*MOT: shes still shes still real oral .
*MOT: she still puts everything in her mouth .
*MOT: and pretty much p like plastic toys is is what she goes for .
*MOT: does she have anything like that at home or does your other daughter .
*EXP: so this is a little bit familiar .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: definitely the plates the utensils and the pretend food .
*EXP: okay so does she have any of these actual food items like pizza ?
*MOT: not specifically .
*MOT: no I think we mi we have a spaghetti that looks just like that .
*MOT: but thats about it .
*MOT: no cookies .
*EXP: no cookies no waffles ?
*MOT: no no .
*EXP: sandwich ?
*MOT: no no sandwich at home .
*MOT: no shes not really familiar with sandwich .
*MOT: we do have the peas .
*EXP: and how about a bottle ?
*MOT: we do have some bottles .
*MOT: but they dont look anything like that .
*MOT: haha no .
*MOT: and she doesnt even take a bottle .
*MOT: haha but she sees them a lot .
*EXP: yeah she knows what theyre for huh ?
*MOT: because we babysit another baby .
*MOT: and that baby takes bottles .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: so do you think that .
*MOT: knows cookies .
*EXP: would be playing with this if if Libby wasnt playing with that stuff .
*EXP: she likes this on her own sort of thing ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I would think so uhhuh .
*EXP: and is it because of her personality or just the stage shes at do you think ?
*MOT: I sort of think its like her her stage .
*MOT: I think I think she still really likes to put stuff in her mouth still .
*MOT: and thats the the most .
*MOT: she also has three teeth currently coming in on the top .
*MOT: so I think .
*EXP: you think the fact that its hard ?
*MOT: I think its its its both exploratory and it feels good .
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: you have a bottle for me ?
*MOT: thank you .
*MOT: um books are actually ha still hard for her because um she doesnt she doesnt care to sit still for too long .
*MOT: like I ha if if Im gonna read to her it hasta be before she goes to sleep .
*MOT: and shes kind of um you know slowed down enough .
*MOT: um and then like s even stuffed animals shes not so big with .
*MOT: my other daughter was real like nurturing even by this age .
*MOT: like she would hold it .
*MOT: and she does that very rarely .
*EXP: she didnt really even go for that stuff did she ?
*MOT: right ?
*EXP: did she like the the WinnieThePooh ?
*MOT: I think she was kind of neutral .
*EXP: okay so those maybe least .
*EXP: and the books not really because shes so active ?
*MOT: yeah and shes really famil .
*MOT: I Im alway I tr try to kind of shove books down their throat a lot I think .
*MOT: so she doesnt really care .
*MOT: shes rather do what she wants to do .
*EXP: do you so would you say that she prefers toys over books then ?
*MOT: yes definitely .
*EXP: and um besides these things that you said you have at home do you have any um any of these actual same books at home or stuffed animals or baby dolls ?
*MOT: we have like similar books to this with the with the um sensory things in them .
*MOT: but not none of these titles no .
*EXP: and um it looked like you were doing some animal things is she interested in that animals and their sounds ?
*MOT: um yeah she like shes really um responsive to music and singing .
*MOT: she she um will like kind of dance every time music starts .
*MOT: or if youre singing and shell s shell try to sing .
*MOT: right you love singing ?
*MOT: haha yeah .
*MOT: do you think she knows any of the animals or their sounds ?
*MOT: um hm no I don I don I dont think she knows to like match them .
*MOT: I know she recognizes them as something familiar .
*MOT: ah I dont know if she would identify yet no .
*EXP: and you but you say animal sounds as well like when you .
*MOT: play a lot yeah .
*EXP: um lets see do you think her interests have changed since the last time she was here a couple months ago ?
*MOT: um I think shes definitely more interactive .
*MOT: with with playing .
*MOT: oh shes got a rip .
*MOT: I think shes definitely more interactive with with me when she plays .
*MOT: last time she was here I know um I felt funny because I felt like I havent been playing with her that much .
*MOT: but she was like so um into like exploring on her own .
*MOT: and I remember when she was a couple months younger like she she could just hang out and play for an hour on her own .
*MOT: just picking stuff up putting it down whatever .
*MOT: and now she definitely wa .
*MOT: I mean shell still do that clearly .
*MOT: but um she likes to play with my husband and I a lot too .
*EXP: yeah it seemed like she was doing that she was really interested .
*EXP: you played some little games with her like put the cookie in and take it out .
*EXP: which hand has the cookie and .
*EXP: she seemed to like that .
*MOT: she definitely she definitely looks for um interaction now .
*MOT: if her sister is not around shell play by herself .
*MOT: but as the minute her sisters in she goes to where she is .
*MOT: you know and its a problem .
*MOT: haha but she always wants to be where she is .
*MOT: playing with her toys and and bugging her .
*EXP: Im just curious does she sort of try to interact with Libby or does she just wanna have .
*MOT: she kind of just wants to have whatever she has yeah .
*MOT: and I think she .
*MOT: I dont know if she knows but .
*MOT: she probably notices theres different toys out .
*MOT: like Libby is allowed to play with different toys than she is .
*MOT: shes not allowed to have the crayons .
*MOT: shes not allowed to have the small pieces .
*MOT: so um so a lot of times when those things are are novel she goes for them .
*MOT: and she is definitely when I was here last time she was not resistant .
*MOT: like if I took a toy away she wouldnt really care .
*MOT: now shell scream at me if I take something away that shes really into .
*EXP: interesting so shes changed a lot .
*EXP: lets see um does she play with dolls at all ?
*MOT: a very little bit and just starting .
*MOT: like the other she got a a a baby doll for Christmas .
*MOT: that um she seems to know is hers .
*MOT: and shes carried that around a bit .
*MOT: and she has a stroller that she pushes .
*MOT: but her absolute fa her absolute favorite at home is this little rideon car that we have in that we have .
*MOT: and she puts herself in it all day long .
*MOT: and kind of yells waiting to be pushed .
*MOT: so thats new .
*MOT: you know she knows she needs somebody to push her .
*EXP: shes communicating that .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: wow .
*MOT: Caroline .
*EXP: youre just amazing .
*EXP: lets see so thats different from last time .
*MOT: was she eight months when we were here last time ?
*MOT: or six ?
*EXP: she was um we try to get get children between six and a half and seven and a half .
*EXP: for the first visit .
*EXP: seven months a little before a little after .
*MOT: peekaboo .
*EXP: she probably wasnt standing up then .
*MOT: well I I know it was hard for her she was in a Bumbo .
*MOT: and I know that was weird for for her .
*MOT: because she was definitely crawling by then .
*MOT: peekaboo do you wanna play peekaboo ?
*MOT: you can play with that peekaboo .
*EXP: does she like that game ?
*MOT: yes she play shell play on her on her own like um whip her head around .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: peekaboo .
*EXP: oh what if just knowing her personality what sort of toys do you think sort of are her .
*MOT: musical ones .
*MOT: yeah um shh I think she I think she understands cause and effect .
*MOT: like I think if theres when theres t we have this big t this big cube toy that when you hit it it sings a song .
*MOT: and she definitely knows to hit it to get the music .
*MOT: and then shell dance to it .
*MOT: so yeah thats definitely those are definitely her her faves .
*EXP: so interesting .
*MOT: is that peekaboo ?
*EXP: well I think thats all I needta ask at this point .
