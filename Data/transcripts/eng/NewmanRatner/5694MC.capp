*MOT: oh .
*MOT: here lets bring this up .
*MOT: what happened ?
*EXP: um so tell me what she was interested in today .
*MOT: uh the kitchen .
*MOT: and food .
*EXP: um is that something common ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: she loves it .
*EXP: um does she have play food .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um and anything similar that she has ?
*MOT: uh we have a lot of cupcakes .
*MOT: she loves those .
*MOT: um actually not much is very similar .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: its kinda new .
*EXP: okay so was any of it new ?
*MOT: most of it was new .
*EXP: um any any examples of things she might have never seen before ?
*MOT: um the pretend food that looked real .
*MOT: ours is soft and doesnt really look all that real .
*EXP: um has she seen any of these foods like in real life ?
*MOT: oh yeah .
*MOT: um she went right for the green beans .
*MOT: uh what else .
*MOT: cupcakes .
*MOT: the cans I think are very new to her .
*MOT: she wasnt exactly sure what they were .
*EXP: um so when she plays with food at home what kinds of things does she do ?
*MOT: um shell well we have a full kitchen so shell put things in the oven and bring us food and feed us .
*EXP: does she have anything she loves to make ?
*MOT: cupcakes .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um so what what are some of those foods that she um had encountered before like in real life ?
*MOT: um well the can stuff .
*MOT: the meats .
*MOT: I guess the size of the um pie and pizza kinda threw her off .
*MOT: and then it was broken .
*EXP: I did hear that .
*EXP: um was there anything any food that was new to her she may never have seen before ?
*MOT: um she probably doesnt remember a kiwi .
*MOT: she hasnt seen a peach unless its cut up in front of her .
*MOT: so I think its different contexts .
*MOT: or different size .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: um what about any um any foods that she plays with at home that we didnt have here ?
*MOT: um mostly shes into the cupcakes .
*MOT: we have a couple different um when she cooks she likes to play with her tea set too so .
*MOT: thats a little different .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: shell make us coffee .
*EXP: um so was she what else did you try to get her to play with today .
*MOT: um the book the dolls which Im surprised she didnt go for .
*MOT: they might be a little big ?
*MOT: shes more into the her sized dolls .
*MOT: and naked so .
*MOT: dolls dressed might have thrown her off .
*EXP: oh okay .
*EXP: um so does she have those at home ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: she her older sister has that those more mature dolls and she has the she prefers the little ones .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um what kinds of things does she do with dolls at home ?
*MOT: takes their clothes off .
*MOT: put them back on .
*MOT: she is very um she loves to take them on walks and put them to sleep and feed them .
*MOT: very maternal type things .
*EXP: um and does she like reading books at home ?
*MOT: she loves it .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: and actually GoodnightMoon is one of her favorites so Im surprised she didnt go right for it .
*MOT: I guess the new toys kind of .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: she was way too interested in the food .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: um anything else she wasnt really interested in ?
*MOT: um the animals .
*MOT: I dont know I dont know if she really plays with them at home either .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: um so thats not really an interest for her ?
*MOT: no .
*MOT: and I dont know if she knew what the um I guess theyre magnets are .
*MOT: theyre all turned upside down so .
*MOT: and theyre beyond the food .
*EXP: right .
*EXP: yeah just that food was the draw from the beginning .
*MOT: yep .
*EXP: um so the kinds of things shes doing with the food today is that pretty typical ?
*MOT: um yeah .
*MOT: normally she has a bigger kitchen and well be more I guess real life with it .
*MOT: she puts things in pots and puts them in the oven .
*MOT: its not exactly what we would eat at home but similar .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: um are there other things that she um that she has at home that we didnt have here that she likes to play with ?
*MOT: um well she likes to dress up .
*MOT: I was kinda surprised that she wouldnt let me put the apron on her .
*MOT: um but mostly food dolls and dress up are her top three choices .
*EXP: we mostly have that but shes uh .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: very focused today .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: um was this similar to the other play sessions I know we have different toys but um her play in previous ones was it similar ?
*MOT: yeah it seems like shes drawn to one thing and kinda focuses .
*EXP: um do you remember what it was in a previous one ?
*MOT: I think there was a bee with the crazy hair .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: she liked that .
*EXP: um and did you did you notice anything about her play that was different from maybe what she normally does ?
*MOT: uh at home ?
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um I guess shes more independent here .
*MOT: normally shell be more willing to give up food .
*MOT: and serve .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um anything else you noticed that you wanted to bring up or ?
*MOT: I dont think so .
