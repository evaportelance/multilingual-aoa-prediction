*MOT: well Id say the peas and the dog .
*EXP: was there any particular dog that she liked ?
*MOT: the the one with the pink collar .
*MOT: yes mhm .
*EXP: that and th do you think um that theres any reason that she likes peas in particular ?
*MOT: she loves peas .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: I mean definitely of this food the peas would be the thing that I think she would recognize as something she eats at home .
*MOT: and she loves them .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: I dont know .
*MOT: maybe thats it .
*EXP: they look xxx .
*MOT: Imean theyre kinda realistic relative to the others .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: and um she tries to eat them so .
*EXP: they do look more foodlike .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: was she interested at all in any of the other .
*MOT: she there was a little milkshake that she was interested in from time to time .
*MOT: and she tried talking on the cheese like it was a cellphone .
*MOT: and um she looked at other stuff .
*MOT: she liked the pitcher .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*MOT: um she like tried put things inside the pitcher .
*EXP: I thought there were some measuring spoons here .
*MOT: oh yeah she looked at the measuring spoons .
*MOT: she liked to shake those .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: hi .
*EXP: does she play with anything similar to these things ?
*EXP: like especially the food items at home ?
*MOT: she has a little picnic set .
*MOT: its plush so I think tactically it would be very different .
*MOT: and Im not sure she would recognize the similarities .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: you know what I mean ?
*MOT: to me or you its like fake food .
*MOT: but but I think its its very different from the plastic stuff .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: yeah yeah .
*EXP: okay so does she have anything like play dishes or plates or just the just the xxx .
*MOT: she she has some play dishes .
*MOT: Imean she has her own dishes that are plastic .
*MOT: that are similar to these but just a little bit bigger .
*MOT: that she plays with .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: oh does she have any babydolls at home ?
*MOT: she has one very small one thats more similar to these than that one .
*MOT: she got kind of scared when .
*EXP: did she ?
*MOT: Imean not really but but she had the bottle and I was trying to show her that the bottle belonged to the baby and she was not pleased with that .
*MOT: not pleased huh ?
*EXP: did she think it was hers do you think ?
*MOT: I think she did .
*MOT: I think she did .
*MOT: I think she sees the babydoll as threatening .
*EXP: thats really interesting .
*MOT: because its almost as big as she is youknow ?
*MOT: shes small for her age .
*MOT: and thats a big doll huh ?
*MOT: thats a big doll .
*EXP: and you were giving it to someone else .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: um lets see xxx .
*EXP: I just wanna make sure xxx .
*MOT: one other thing that I thought was funny .
*MOT: was that she liked all the stuffed animals .
*MOT: but she definitely recognized that that little brown one with the pink furry thing as a dog .
*MOT: and she um she howled at it .
*MOT: which my husband taught her to howl with the dogs .
*MOT: so she was like communicating with the little dogs .
*EXP: so she must have known that was a dog .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: I think so .
*MOT: I think so .
*EXP: thats interesting .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: because it doesnt look that much like a dog .
*MOT: well not that much .
*EXP: xxx four legs .
*MOT: it has the four legs .
*MOT: and we have yorkies at home who are really small and .
*EXP: got it .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: got it .
*EXP: xxx see here .
*MOT: Heidi whered you shoe go ?
*EXP: does she express any interest in books ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: she she did .
*MOT: she likes books .
*MOT: she loves them at home but I think there were so many other distractions here but .
*MOT: she liked this one .
*MOT: and she loves the pet and feel book .
*EXP: she has some of those at home ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: so have her interests changed since she was here ?
*EXP: I know she was here pretty recently .
*MOT: I dont think so .
*MOT: Imean I think they probably change a little bit day by day .
*MOT: youknow just what her mood is and whats more interesting in that moment .
*MOT: but um but I wouldnt say that her interests have changed really .
*MOT: shes I noticed that shes maturing very quickly it seems to me .
*MOT: like shes developing quickly and is able to do things that wasnt able to do and is more expressive and communicative .
*MOT: and is better able to let me know what she wants .
*MOT: but I dont think her wants are really different from what theyve been .
*MOT: theyre just shes better able to .
*MOT: to express them .
*EXP: do you think shes playing differently than she was with the toys ?
*MOT: um I dont remember well enough to to say really .
*EXP: if she was you might remember .
*MOT: yeah Imean I think maybe last time we had a little bit more success just reading books all the way through .
*MOT: and now she was just a little more interested in everything else that was going on around .
*EXP: uhhuh .
*EXP: she seems like she got to all the groups .
*MOT: yeah she did .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: she did .
*EXP: so you read a little bit to her with the book that she picked out .
*MOT: yeah we almost finished that one .
*MOT: and we got about half way through the peekababy book .
*EXP: uhuh .
*MOT: and I think thats it .
*MOT: so there was some interest .
*MOT: yeah yeah .
*MOT: at home when we read we youknow sit down in a chair and read through four books at a time .
*MOT: and shes shes really into it .
*MOT: but but youknow its not in an environment like this where she gets to choose what she wants to do .
*EXP: right .
*MOT: uhoh .
*EXP: shoes .
*EXP: shoes are off .
*EXP: I think thats it .
*EXP: unless theres anything that you noticed that I didnt ask you about .
*MOT: I dont think so .
*EXP: xxx so cute .
*MOT: say thankyou .
*EXP: so next time shes gonna be two .
*MOT: two .

*MOT: half are boys .
*EXP: oh .

*EXP: does she have any animals that are her favorites ?
*MOT: um in general ?
*MOT: shh Imean we have dogs and shes a little obsessed with dogs .
*MOT: but she also is very partial to pigs .
*MOT: and um .
*MOT: and giraffes .
*MOT: maybe .
*MOT: but xxx I think the hierarchy is dogs then pigs .
*MOT: then maybe giraffes and beavers .
*MOT: and then everything else .
*EXP: ah .
*EXP: and do you have toys that are similar to these at home ?
*MOT: you know um .
*MOT: that thats kindof a tough question to answer right now because we are um uh .

*MOT: she liked this doll .
*EXP: do you have um kindof similar big kid dolls ?
*MOT: no we dont and actually my grandma wanted to get her one for her birthday and I said I didnt think she was ready and I may needta reconsider that for Christmas because she liked it .
*MOT: so yeah .
*EXP: yeah and their gender is kindof hard to tell .

*EXP: yeah I try to take off all the pink before people come in to preserve .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: but then Heddie um Heddie called it a him a couple of times so maybe she thought it was a boy .

*MOT: she likes to help in the kitchen and she also she really loved her play kitchen before we packed it up she liked to invite people into her little house and to give them things and shed like carry it around on a tray and get upset if you didnt eat it .
*EXP: were any of these foods here things that she eats in real life ?
*MOT: she loves hotdogs when we go to Costco thats a special treat for her .

*MOT: shes always liked peas .
*MOT: but um Imean we eat alot of greenbeans but they look very different from the greenbeans you have .
*MOT: um so I dont think that much of the food was part of her youknow kindof her regulars or her favorites .
*EXP: and she knows um and she knew um she had that birthday .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: yyy cupcakes or muffins .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: yes yes cupcakes definitely she would know .
*EXP: yeah for some of them that is a marvelous new thing .
*MOT: she loves toys like that like the cupcakes that are um um like little things in a series that are connected somehow .
*MOT: when um .
*MOT: when I was we visited my moms house in Denver for a month and .
*MOT: my moms house is like a wonderland its like you landed in a fairy godmothers place .
*MOT: and of all the toys and all of the youknow these huge open spaces which we just dont have in the city and everything that was there her favorite thing .
*MOT: was a set of um .
*MOT: popsicle molds .
*MOT: it was very much like a muffin tin youknow its it was like six little things like a muffin tin like thing that had stars .
*EXP: oh yeah .
*MOT: like plastic star stick tops that went into it and she didnt know that it was popsicle mold .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: but she loved it and she wanted to take it to sleep her and she liked arranging the pink stars and the orange stars in specific ways .
*MOT: and then um we were at my brothers place .
*MOT: a couple of weeks ago and he had a popsicle mold set that was different .
*MOT: these the plastic covers of the popsicles came off it looked totally different but it was the same kind of thing it was like a series of things that was not totally dissimilar from the cupcake thing here .
*MOT: and she loved it and she took it all over the house with her .
*MOT: so theres something about that particular type of toy that she finds extremely intriguing .
*MOT: or not even toy because the others theyre werent toys theyre just objects .
*MOT: but something about having something that fits into something else thats part of a series is really pleasing to her .
*EXP: that is cool .
