*MOT: yeah that looks kinda realistic .
*EXP: it does .
*MOT: have you ever had one ?
*EXP: alright .
*MOT: you can play .
*EXP: you can play .
*EXP: so how do you think she um today compares with the last time that she was here in terms of what she wanted to do ?
*MOT: I think it um is very similar to her sister also that there she had a more varied interest last time .
*MOT: and this time it was pretty much in the middle category of plastic products .
*EXP: and is she teething also ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: yes she cut her most recent tooth little less than a week ago .
*MOT: like five days ago .
*EXP: so you were just on schedule .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: okay did she have any particular um items that .
*MOT: she went straight for the pizza pieces and really kind of came kept coming back to the pizza though .
*MOT: thats her favorite .
*EXP: huh .
*EXP: it sounds like you showed her other things ?
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: I did .
*MOT: she liked this bottle too .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: I would say this one .
*MOT: the bottle was her second favorite .
*MOT: yeah and then she did spend some time with the sandwich parts um but not as much .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: shes probably not had a sandwich that looks like that .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: but she hasnt had pizza that looks like it either .
*EXP: I think the peas are the most realistic looking youknow of .
*EXP: the food items .
*EXP: did she pay any attention to those ?
*MOT: um she did pick them up once and chewing on them a little bit .
*MOT: um I definitely think they they look realistic but um when she eats peas theyre like little cheerios you know she can pick them up with xxx and do them in their spread out so um Im not sure she associated that with what peas are .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: thats right it .
*MOT: you did like that .
*MOT: icecream cone too .
*MOT: not that she knows what an icecream cone is .
*MOT: no .
*MOT: no she hasnt had icecream .
*EXP: okay so that must be why you think maybe she wants to chew on things .
*MOT: I think she yeah I think shes just teething and likes to likes different textures and the way it feels in her mouth .
*EXP: how about the other things ?
*EXP: did she pay any attention to the any of the animals ?
*MOT: um a little bit at the beginning and I tried to get her interested in the puppet but she kept eating the pizza .
*EXP: so .
*EXP: you didnt like the kangaroo .
*EXP: I like that one cause it has the baby .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: I do too I think thats really cute .
*MOT: and I thought that would be different we dont we dont have puppets at home I should probably get some but we dont we dont have any of those so I thought she might respond to that because its different but .
*EXP: does she have any of these kind of any animals that are the same as what we have ?
*MOT: uh we have a Pooh a Pooh bear .
*MOT: about that size too .
*MOT: um and we have animals that are similar but not the not the exact ones .
*EXP: so you dont have an eagle ?
*MOT: we dont have an eagle no .
*EXP: and .
*MOT: or the donkey the patriotic donkey we dont have that either .
*EXP: a little unusual .
*MOT: right .
*EXP: um and what about the books ?
*MOT: she didnt go for the books at all um to be fair I didnt really try very hard to get her interested in it .
*EXP: and then she probably didnt xxx did she .
*MOT: no she didnt go over to this category of things at all .
*EXP: okay so it was really mostly the food items ?
*MOT: yeah things that feel good to chew on .
*EXP: okay um did she play with that .
*EXP: I know you said it was new .
*EXP: does she play with those new toys at home the those new um food items ?
*MOT: yeah she does and its the same thing she puts them right in her mouth it .
*MOT: theyre good to chew on and interesting um Imean she pushes the shopping cart around but I dont think she knows that shes pushing a shopping cart around I think its just a developmental skill shes at the point where she wants to practice walking .
*EXP: alright .
*MOT: but um .
*MOT: but yeah she enjoys playing with the food items at home .
*MOT: but we dont have these particular ones .
*MOT: we dont have little pizzas .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: sandwhi a sandwich that look like this or anything like that .
*EXP: um lets see if I have .
*MOT: baby .
*MOT: can you come here please ?
*MOT: no .
*EXP: so she has that and um at home would you say that she has a favorite kind of toy ?
*EXP: when I know that shes teething so maybe that this influences this .
*MOT: I really dont think she has a favorite kind of toy she lo she likes a variety of things .
*MOT: at home she like books .
*MOT: she spends a lot of time with books .
*MOT: um she spends a lot of time with stuffed animals and things that look like they have a personality like shell talk to things and um she uh shes different in her from her sister in that way she she she really responds more to things that look like little creatures .
*MOT: um and then she does her fair share of chewing on plastic things .
*MOT: but so she she kind of runs a gamut .
*EXP: yeah thats really xxx .
*MOT: at home .
*EXP: its too bad .
*MOT: much more than you saw here today .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: well the teething can can can have a big influence xxx its too bad we dont have a dog that looks .

*EXP: oh theres a .
*EXP: thats right .
*MOT: I dont know where it went .

*EXP: right .
*EXP: does she ever like help you in the kitchen ?
*EXP: like she seemed to like .
*MOT: she likes stirring but I dont let the twins help me in the kitchen just I feel like theyre a little bit young and my um .
*MOT: my niece got a bad burn from helping in the kitchen so I as a mom Im just really a little bit shy of them helping helping out with that so .
*EXP: some kids like to help up like cake mixtures youknow stuff like that .
*MOT: right .
*MOT: right I think theyre a little bit young yet well definitely be doing that some in the next year but .
*EXP: but its interesting because they know what to do at the stove so they know what .
*MOT: theyve watched it .
*EXP: exactly so .
*EXP: they love pretending cook and .
*MOT: oh thanks yyy .
*MOT: yeah she seemed to like that .
*EXP: what about with the animals like did she recognize .
*MOT: she recognized alot shes not I w dont not all of them .
*MOT: and some youknow this she said Dino for the rhinoceros .
*MOT: because weve been youknow watching some dinosaur programs on tv it does kinda look like a dinosaur I think shes right um .
*MOT: but she recognized elephant zebra .
*MOT: um she recognized the sheep .
*MOT: and she recognized almost all the underwater animals .
*MOT: so yeah she knows a fair many of them .
*EXP: have you gone to the aquarium or something ?

*EXP: ah okay .
*MOT: from that .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: or like has she xxx yeah because like she didnt play with any of these ones .
*MOT: thanks .
*MOT: no she didnt she gravitated more towards the mag the cartoony looking magnet ones than the realistic .
*EXP: yeah these ones are more theyre not as pretty as the like the ones we have in the xxx soft .
*EXP: more for big kids but .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: and some of these are kinda weird animals so I know alot of kids arent familiar with them .
*MOT: uhuh .
*EXP: has she been to the zoo er .
*MOT: weve been to the zoo out in Reston .
*MOT: um so its more like a wild animal kind of thing than a .
*EXP: yeah so shes seen lions and stuff like that .
*MOT: um I dont think there are lions at that one shes seen the they have zebra and they have um .
*MOT: they have antelope and .
*MOT: um its a petting zoo so theyve got youknow goats and things for them to pet .
*MOT: kangaroo .
*EXP: yeah she knows alot of uh names so I was like they both have really big vocabularies so I was .

*EXP: and then she didnt seem to be too interested in the dolls I guess .
*MOT: no not so much .
*MOT: she was .
*EXP: does she have dolls at home ?
*MOT: she does have dolls at home .
*MOT: um yeah .
*MOT: and sometimes shes very interested in that .
*MOT: shes um shes very maternal she tends to anything with a face is shell .
*MOT: and sometimes shell say oh hes sad and so just so that she can hug the um the toy or the animal or baby so .
*MOT: so no I think its not typical that she didnt go right for that usually she does .
*EXP: maybe because she has them at home so shes kinda like .
*MOT: for me ?
*MOT: oh .
*EXP: like pretend to dress them and stuff too because I think you were trying to get her to but .
*MOT: I was and she doesnt she hasnt been doing a whole lot of dressing she does alot of wrapping up in blankets and comforting them .
*MOT: and have and feeding them shell do pretend diaper changes .
*MOT: but not so much taking clothes off and on .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so other than that we havent done that much at home .
*EXP: yeah she seemed uh I think she liked that once she realized it was there because at first she didnt even notice it she was wrapped up into the animals I think but .
*MOT: oh that looks good .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: she seemed to like it .
*EXP: I think alot of kids know this book too but um .
*EXP: usually when we see them play with it they dont like even never really see them name too much on the page so that was cool like she was going through and shes like .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: the kitten or whatever I havent read this book in so long .
*MOT: right its .
