*EXP: hes twenty one .
*MOT: you love keys dont ya ?
*MOT: you think you wanna drive a car ?
*MOT: hm ?
*EXP: oh thatll be the day .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: I think youre a little too small to see over the steering wheel .
*MOT: xxx they make booster seats and long brake pedals .
*MOT: for the short people .
*MOT: are you showing off over there ?
*EXP: now Im gonna ask you some questions .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: you did a good job .
*EXP: alright so what was the first thing that he went to ?
*EXP: first toy do you remember ?
*MOT: um I showed him the bee .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um I dont know what he went to on his own .
*MOT: probably the keys .
*MOT: or no actually the book Im sorry .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: does he play with so he went to the the bee that was like put together like that ?
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: um does he have any stuffed animals at home ?
*MOT: he was some but I keep a lot of them put up because theyre like little stuff attached to them like his brother has .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so I dont have a lot of the stuffed animals out just a couple .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: so he doesnt really play with those that much right now .
*EXP: so why do you think he wanted to pick up that first ?
*MOT: this one ?
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: probably because its different .
*MOT: he probably doesnt see much something like this that often .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: and anything sticking up attracts him .
*MOT: youknow the little antennas or the wings .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: you kicked your shoe off and your sock .
*EXP: so so he liked he went to that bee and then he looked at the keys .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: does he have have this at home ?
*MOT: yeah he has them on a ring .
*MOT: like the baby keys .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: so that was familiar to him .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: because theyre not on a ring like that its theyre just by themselves .
*MOT: right but they theyre shaped similar to this .
*MOT: so its probably why he they look familiar .
*MOT: and he also has the teethers that look similar to that so maybe thats why he .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: so and you said he also looked in the book .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: does he have that one at home ?
*MOT: we have one similar .
*MOT: the GoodnightMoon without the counting .
*MOT: so we we have um it looks almost exactly like that from the front .
*MOT: so big .
*EXP: do you have a lot of books at home ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: is that something he .
*MOT: mhm .
*MOT: we read every night before we go to bed .
*MOT: him and his brother and I .
*MOT: we read .
*EXP: um what was there anything that just was not interested anything that he did xxx ?
*MOT: he didnt really play with many of the stuffed animals I hadta introduce them to him .
*MOT: um I showed him the clock and he kinda waved that around but he didnt really go to any of the food items at all .
*MOT: um we have them at home so I dont know if maybe thats why .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: because hes seen them before .
*MOT: because his brother has some of this stuff now .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: so I cant think of anything .
*EXP: he didnt look at that xxx .
*MOT: he didnt look at anything over here at all .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: usually at this age they are all over this stuff like on their mouths and everything .
*MOT: yeah he put the well I I showed him the icecreams and he put them in his mouth .
*MOT: but I hadta show him um hes very concentrated when he plays he doesnt wander a lot .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: so its funny hell stick on the same thing for quite a while and we have a lot of toys in our playroom .
*MOT: so hes very content with one or two things a lot of times .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: it looks like he likes that bee .
*MOT: its really cool isnt it ?
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: so you dont do you have anything like that at home ?
*MOT: similar .
*MOT: um we do have some like um like a pizza at home .
*MOT: and bread .
*MOT: um and he does play with the spoon a lot um at home .
*MOT: so these should be familiar to him and we also go to the library where they have a fantasy area where he can play with this kind of stuff .
*MOT: and we were actually there today looking at um like in a kitchen area .
*MOT: so hes hes familiar with these items .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: here you go .
*EXP: so do you think maybe he likes to play with that because he doesnt have ?
*MOT: I think maybe because and theyre um anything that like looks um that sticks out he tends to draw his attention .
*MOT: that he can play with with his fingers .
*MOT: hes very fascinated with touching things .
*MOT: so he likes to um youknow check things out a lot .
*MOT: like hell crawl across the room for a speck of leaf on the carpet .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: yes he is .
*MOT: dont put it in your mouth .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: so do you remember the last visit when you did this same type of thing ?
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: um are there any changes ?
*MOT: hes definitely a lot more um interested in new things .
*MOT: I think before he was still a little younger .
*MOT: and I in the last couple months hes definitely blossomed a lot more .
*MOT: now that he can crawl hes out hell hell explore a lot more so I think um he definitely tries more than he did before .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: you playing peekaboo ?
*MOT: dont put it in your mouth .
*MOT: good job .
*EXP: so you would say that this time he looked at a lot more than he did .
*MOT: I think so yeah .
*MOT: because last time I I hadta really initiate it a lot more .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: and so I think this time he um .
*MOT: even though Id initiate some this time he was a lot more interested on his own and try to crawl up and play with things that he wouldnt have before .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: and what about the doll ?
*EXP: that was not really ?
*MOT: doesnt interest him .
*MOT: it didnt this time at all .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: I dunno its because we dont have them at home .
*EXP: yeah he has a brother you said ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: and he Imean he goes over to somebodys house to play thats a girl but I dont know if they even play with it there that much .
*MOT: youre so big .
*MOT: youre so into youre so big ?
*EXP: so what do you think .
*EXP: you said you read to him every night .
*EXP: what do you think he prefers books or toys ?
*EXP: he likes the reading the books or ?
*MOT: I I think its probably about the same but I think in general he seemed to like the toys a little more .
*EXP: mhm .
*EXP: um and do you think at this point um as opposed to different from last time that he recognizes the names of some of these items more ?
*EXP: like some of the animals ?
*MOT: he may .
*MOT: um I havent really sat down with him lately and and had a lot of one on one time with him .
*MOT: um so thats probably not as good as it could be .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: potty training his brother has been a been a new priority lately so .
*EXP: oh so theyre close in age ?
*MOT: yeah his brothers three .
*EXP: oh .
*MOT: and hes ten months so theyre just a little over two years apart .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: um so do you think that theres anything else that you just noticed about this play session that you might wanna add that anything that was like maybe surprised you about what he liked to look at or what he wasnt interested in ?
*MOT: no this is pretty much the same type of toys he would see generally .
*MOT: it every day it changes with him so I cant think of anything special or different or anything .
*EXP: okay .
*EXP: alright that was great .
*EXP: I just have a few questions .
*MOT: okay .
*EXP: what um toys did you think that Luke liked to play with the most ?
*MOT: um anything food related .
*MOT: he loved the pizza wedges the most .
*EXP: does he have similar toys at home ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: his actually his brother does and I think he maybe recognized that from before .
*EXP: does he like to play pretend with the foods ?
*MOT: um hes just starting to .
*MOT: so hes just starting to get more active on that part .
*MOT: before he wasnt as interested .
*MOT: so I think these last few weeks hes really starting to come around and realize what the food means .
*EXP: yeah xxx utensils and everything .
*MOT: yeah he started to practice with the spoon and he he can feed himself with his fingers .
*EXP: what do you think he likes the least ?
*MOT: um its hard to say he didnt really get too far from this range .
*MOT: um he didnt really seem too interested in the book I read him .
*MOT: only held his attention for a short time .
*EXP: what book did you read him ?
*MOT: um we read Peekababy .
*EXP: do you like to read at home ?
*MOT: yes we do read at home a lot .
*EXP: okay what books do you have at home ?
*EXP: whats his favorite ?
*MOT: quite a few .
*MOT: um we have a lot of the DoctorSeuss books the little card the little board books a lot .
*MOT: um that I read with his brother too so we usually read as a family .
*MOT: a lot .
*MOT: hey buddy .
*EXP: does he usually play with dolls at home or no ?
*MOT: no since theyre just the two boys they dont are not really um exposed to dolls as much .
*MOT: we do go to playgroups but I dont think hes noticed so .
*MOT: thats why I thought this time I would see what he would do and he was kind of intrigued for a second but that he wasnt as didnt keep his attention too long .
*EXP: um is there anything that you remember him playing with last time that you thought he had the same interest in ?
*MOT: um no I he was all over the keys last time and I dont even know if he s didnt see them because they were by under the books but he he played with new things this time .
*EXP: what else um so he didnt play with any of the same things this time ?
*MOT: mm I think the only thing we did the same was maybe read this book .
*MOT: and I think the toy order might have been a little different .
*MOT: so I dunno if that might have been why .
*MOT: I dont remember how the layout was exactly .
*EXP: do you think he recognizes any of the foods ?
*EXP: like does he does he eat any of these foods at home ?
*MOT: um no hes not onto solids yet hes still on baby food .
*MOT: but um he does I notice he does wanna try to put them in his mouth so I think hes maybe getting that correlation that it is food though .
*EXP: do you think maybe he recognizes food that you eat ?
*MOT: oh Im sure .
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: because we eat a lot of um like pizza and that kind of stuff because of his brother .
*MOT: what did ya find buddy ?
*MOT: a spoon ?
*EXP: which of the animals did he seem to like ?
*MOT: the only thing he really played with was with the bee word .
*MOT: um we watch the show at home so I know he knows these a lot .
*MOT: um but he didnt really show any interest in any of the other ones .
*MOT: oh and I showed him the frog but he didnt gear towards it I hadta prompt it .
*EXP: do you have any animals at home ?
*MOT: yeah .
*MOT: uh you mean as far as pets or stuffed animals ?
*EXP: either .
*MOT: um we dont have any pets we have tons of stuffed animals so he plays with those a lot at home .
*EXP: which ones his favorite ?
*MOT: at home ?
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um probably its his teddybear thats also his security blanket its like attached .
*MOT: so hes usually plays with that the most .
*MOT: yeah .
*EXP: you did great .
*EXP: thanks so much for coming in .
*MOT: oh youre welcome .
*MOT: its kinda fun to play with him by ourselves .
*MOT: we usually have his brother to contend with so .
*EXP: its a great opportunity then .
*MOT: you got to play by yourself without your brother snapping stuff away from you .
*EXP: can I ask a couple of questions about your .
*MOT: sure .
*EXP: um so do you mind just like walking me through the session and what he played with and everything ?
*MOT: he mostly gravitated towards the food items .
*EXP: mhm .
*MOT: um we have that stuff at home so I think maybe hes familiar with it and maybe thats why .
*MOT: um him and his brother play with kitchen and food items a lot .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: um do you think he knows any of these foods or ?
*MOT: he may .
*MOT: um I talk I try to talk to him as I give him new items and try to explain what they are .
*MOT: so its hard to say .
*MOT: youknow if hes .
*MOT: I know that they comprehend it but I dont youknow I dont know to what extent he can put the two together yet .
*EXP: which of these foods do you have at home ?
*MOT: spaghetti pizza peas icecream waffles so Im sure those were familiar to him .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: I was surprised he was able to figure out to put the waffle on the plate .
*EXP: thats funny .
*EXP: does he eat anything or ?
*MOT: you mean .
*EXP: like eat any of these like does he try them at the table or .
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: he has had them all at one point or another .
*MOT: yes .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: thats cool .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: um do we what about any of the other toys that captured his interest or that he might know the name for or ?
*MOT: um he didnt seem to be interested at all in the babydoll stuff and thats probably because with two boys at home we dont have any of that at our house .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: um so he didnt even gravitate towards that .
*MOT: he seemed interested in the book but youknow that didnt last but a couple seconds .
*EXP: um does he eat um do you read to him at home or anything ?
*MOT: yes we do read at home .
*EXP: okay .
*MOT: so .
*MOT: his attention span doesnt last .
*MOT: Luke .
*MOT: sorry its the light .
*MOT: come here buddy .
*MOT: hes very uh inquisitive .
*MOT: come here .
*EXP: do you think he knows the names for any of these animals or ?
*MOT: he may .
*MOT: um he hasnt actually verbally said a lot of them but we sing songs like um that have this the animal sounds in them so .
*MOT: he may but he didnt seem too interested I was surprised because before he seemed to gravitate towards some of the animals but this time he didnt .
*EXP: do you think he sees any of them on tv or ?
*MOT: he should notice these because we watch this show all the time .
*MOT: WordWorld so .
*MOT: um he just didnt Im surprised he didnt notice them this time he didnt last time we were here but .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: um do you think theres any toy that .
*EXP: I dunno like what are other differences you noticed between like this session and previous sessions with what hes been interested in or ?
*MOT: this time I didnt hafta en get him engaged as much he was able to just reach and play for things I think its just at that hes at that age now where hes not afraid to go explore on his own .
*MOT: before he was v and he now hes more mobile which is a lot different too .
*EXP: yeah .
*MOT: um before he didnt get up and walk around so he was very limited to what he did .
*EXP: do does him does he and his brother play at home a lot too ?
*MOT: yes .
*MOT: mhm .
*EXP: what kinda toys do they play with ?
*MOT: um they have kitchen stuff they have cars um they have um tons of books um .
*MOT: they have other toys that youknow you can engage where they talk when you put a ball in .
*MOT: youknow all those kinda toys so .
*MOT: there ve definitely not limited in their toy selection .
*EXP: yeah .
*EXP: thats cool though .
*EXP: um is there anything else you think we should know or ?
*MOT: Luke can you leave that there ?
*MOT: no theres nothing um hes just starting to babble more so Im sure hes gonna start spitting out words soon so .
*MOT: thats probably the only difference recently too .
*EXP: cool .
*EXP: well thats all I have for you .
*MOT: sorry about the the uh the older brother today .
*EXP: oh no its no problem .
