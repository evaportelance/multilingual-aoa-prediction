*MOT: read the book .
*NAR: butter battle book by DrSeuss RamdomHouse NewYork .
*MOT: Jeffrey .
*NAR: copyright nineteen eighty four .
*SIB: what ?
*MOT: youre not gonna read it if you dont straighten up .
*SIB: are you gonna read it ?
*MOT: are you gonna read it ?
*SIB: you want me to yes .
*MOT: then do it .
*NAR: on the last day of summer ten hours before fall .
*SIB: Im gonna turn the page .
*NAR: my grandfather took me out to the wall .
*SIB: move your hands .
*SIB: dont .
*MOT: shh .
*MOT: Jeffrey .
*MOT: let Jeffrey turn the pages okay ?
*NAR: for a while he stood silent then finally he said with a very sad shake of his very old head as you know on this side of the wall we are Zukes and on the other side of wall live the Zukes .
*NAR: and my grandfather said its high time that you know of the terribly horrible thing that Zukes do in every Zuke house and in every Zuke town .
*NAR: every Zuke eats his bread with the butter side down but we Zukes as you know .
*CHI: mom xxx .
*NAR: when we breakfast or sup spread our bread grandpa said with the butter side up .
*NAR: thats the right honest way .
*NAR: grandpa clenched his teeth so you cant trust a Zuke who spreads bread underneath .
*NAR: every Zuke must be watched he had kinks in his soul thats why as a youth I made watching my goal watching Zukes for the Zuke watching border patrol .
*SIB: theres a sign that says Zukes are not Zukes .
*SIB: keep your butter side up .
*CHI: butter side down .
*MOT: read .
*NAR: pausing here for salt Ill have no more nonsense I said with a frown from Zukes who eat bread with the butter side down van nick looked quite sickly he ran off quite quickly Im unhappy to say he came back the next day with a spiffy new suit with a big new machine and he snarled as he said .
*NAR: pausing here for salt just smiled he said youre not to blame and those Zukes will be sorry they started this game well dress you right up in a fancier suit well give you a fancier sling shot to shoot and he ordered the boys in the back room to figger how to build me some sort of triple sling jigger with my triple sling jigger I sure felt much bigger I marched to the wall with great vim and great vigor right up to VanNich with my hand on the trigger .
*NAR: in those days of course the wall wasnt so high and I could look any Zuke square in the eye if he dared come close I could give him a twitch with my tough tufted prickly snickberry switch for a while that worked fine all the Zukes stayed away and our country was safe till one terrible day a very rude Zuke by the name of VanNich snuck up and sling shotted my snickberry switch with my broken off switch with my head hung in shame to the chief Ukeroo in great sorrow I came but our leader .
*SIB: I think shes doing double time .
*NAR: I was racing PellMell when I heard a voice yell .
*NAR: if you sprinkle us Zukes youll get sprinkled as well .
*NAR: because VanNich had a sputter exactly like mine and he yelled .
*NAR: my blue gooer is working just fine and Im here to say that if Zukes can goo Zukes youd better forget it .
*NAR: Zukes can goo Zukes .
*NAR: I flew right back home and as you may have guessed I was downright despondent disturbed and depressed .
*NAR: pausing here for salt but it had several faucets which sprinkled blue goo which somehow would sprinkle these Zukes as I flew and gum up those upside down butter xxx .
*NAR: pausing here for salt my boys in the back room have finally found how just wait till you see what theyve puttered up now this great new machine will fly over the wall and clobber those butter down Zukes one and all those boys in the back room sure knew how to putter they made me a thing called the utterly sputter and I jumped aboard with my heart all a flutter and steered toward the land of the upside down butter the machine was so modern so frightfully new no one knew quite exactly what it would do .
*NAR: the chief Ukaroo had sent them to meet me along with right side up song girls to greet me they sang oh be faithful believe in thy butter and they lifted my spirits right outof the gutter my boy said the chief Ukaroo weve just voted and made you a general youve been promoted your pretty uniform is ready get in the big war is coming youre going to be in it and whats more this time you are certain to win it .

*NAR: poor Daniel and I were scared outof our wits once more by VanNich .
*NAR: I was bested and beat .

*NAR: I dragged and I sagged and my spirits were low .
*NAR: as low as I thought that they ever could go .
*NAR: when I heard a boon bah and diddly deal and our butter side up man marched over the hill the chief .
*NAR: pausing here for salt and they carefully trained a real smart dog named Daniel to serve as our countrys first gun toting Spaniel then Daniel the kick a poo Spaniel and I marched toward the wall with our heads held up high while they roared and cheered and their cheers filled the sky fight .
*NAR: fight for the butter side up .
*NAR: do or die .

*NAR: pausing here for salt theyll think you one up and well send you right back they thought up a great one they certainly did they loaded up a gun called the kick a poo kid which they loaded with powerful poo a doo powder and ants eggs and bees legs and dried fried clam chowder .
*NAR: pausing here for salt sling shots old boy are not modern enough all we need is some new fangled kind of gun the boys in my back room have already begun to think of wall walloping whiz zinger one my bright boys are thinking theyre on the right track .

*NAR: drop this bomb on the Zukes just as fast as you can .
*NAR: I have ordered all Zukes to stay safe underground while the bitsy big boy boomaroo is around .
*NAR: as I raced for that wall with the bomb in my hand I noticed that every last Zuke in our land was obeying the chief Ukeroos grim command .
