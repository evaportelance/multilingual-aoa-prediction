*MOT: and they were getting sort of stronger .
*MOT: and it must have been about midnight or so .
*MOT: they were saying to me .
*MOT: try and get some sleep and all .
*MOT: but I couldnt .
*MOT: because they were getting a lot stronger .
*MOT: and I knew there was no way I was getting any sleep .

*MOT: youknow its really bad .
*MOT: so she says .
*MOT: Ill come down to the bed and feel your tummy and that .

*MOT: and theyre only fifteen minutes apart .
*MOT: but then there was one on top of eachother .
*MOT: and then they were really strong .
*MOT: and I started shaking and all and she says .
*MOT: are you nervous ?
*MOT: but I couldnt stop myself .
*MOT: but apparently I was in shock a wee bit .
*INV: dear love you .
*MOT: and then I pranced about the ward .
*MOT: and I was in and outof the toilet .
*MOT: and they were getting really strong .
*MOT: and I was sitting up and bending down and leaning over and .
*MOT: but they were still far apart and close together .
